        "caption": "Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are key regulators of cell proliferation, tumor-induced angiogenesis, and migration. FGFs are essential for early embryonic development, organ formation, and angiogenesis. FGF1 also plays an important role in inflammation, wound healing, and restenosis. The biological effects of FGF1 are mediated through the activation of the four transmembrane phosphotyrosine kinase fibroblast growth factor receptors in the presence of heparin sulfate proteoglycans and, therefore, require the release of the protein into the extracellular space. FGF1 is exported through a non-classical release pathway involving the formation of a specific multiprotein complex. The protein constituents of this complex include FGF1, S100A13, and the p40 form of synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). Because FGF1 plays an important role in tumor formation, it is clear that preventing the formation of the multiprotein complex would be an effective strategy to inhibit a wide range of cancers. To understand the molecular events in the FGF1 release pathway, we studied the FGF1-S100A13 tetrameric and FGF1-S100A13-C2A hexameric complex structures, which are both complexes possibly formed during the non-classical pathway of FGF1 release."

Inhibition by most reported MBL inhibitors involves zinc ion chelation. A structure-based virtual screening approach combined with NMR filtering led to the identification of inhibitors of the clinically relevant Verona Integron-encoded MBL (VIM)-2. Crystallographic analyses reveal a new mode of MBL inhibition involving binding adjacent to the active site zinc ions, but which does not involve metal chelation. The results will aid efforts to develop new types of clinically useful inhibitors targeting MBLs/MBL-fold metallo-enzymes involved in antibacterial and anticancer drug resistance."

A plant-derived lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum SN35N has been previously found to harbor the gene cluster encoding the CBS- and CGL-like enzymes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the L. plantarum CBS can synthesize cystathionine from O-acetyl-L-serine and L-homocysteine. The aim of this study is to characterize the enzymatic functions of the L. plantarum CGL. We have found that the enzyme has the high \u03b3-lyase activity toward cystathionine to generate L-cysteine, together with the \u03b2-lyase activity toward L-cystine to generate L-cysteine persulfide. By the crystallographic analysis of the inactive CGL K194A mutant complexed with cystathionine, we have found the residues which recognize the distal amino and carboxyl groups of cystathionine or L-cystine. The PLP-bound substrates at the active site may take either the binding pose for the \u03b3- or \u03b2-elimination reaction, with the former being the major reaction in the case of cystathionine."

In all domains of life, it is a ribozyme: the RNase P RNA (RPR) component has been demonstrated to be responsible for catalysis. However, the number of RNase P protein subunits (RPPs) varies from 1 in bacteria to 9 or 10 in eukarya. The archaeal RPR is associated with at least 4 RPPs, which function in pairs (RPP21-RPP29 and RPP30-POP5). We used solution NMR spectroscopy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein-protein complex comprising Pyrococcus furiosus RPP21 and RPP29. We found that the protein-protein interaction is characterized by coupled folding of secondary structural elements that participate in interface formation. In addition to detailing the intermolecular contacts that stabilize this 30-kDa binary complex, the structure identifies surfaces rich in conserved basic residues likely vital for recognition of the RPR and/or precursor tRNA. Furthermore, enzymatic footprinting experiments allowed us to localize the RPP21-RPP29 complex to the specificity domain of the RPR. These findings provide valuable new insights into mechanisms of RNP assembly and serve as important steps towards a three-dimensional model of this ancient RNP enzyme."

ABA signaling is normally repressed by group-A protein phosphatases 2C (PP2Cs), but stress-induced ABA binds Arabidopsis PYR/PYL/RCAR (PYL) receptors, which then bind and inhibit PP2Cs. X-ray structures of several receptor-ABA complexes revealed a tunnel above ABA's 3' ring CH that opens at the PP2C binding interface. Here, ABA analogs with sufficiently long 3' alkyl chains were predicted to traverse this tunnel and block PYL-PP2C interactions. To test this, a series of 3'-alkylsulfanyl ABAs were synthesized with different alkyl chain lengths. Physiological, biochemical and structural analyses revealed that a six-carbon alkyl substitution produced a potent ABA antagonist that was sufficiently active to block multiple stress-induced ABA responses in vivo. This study provides a new approach for the design of ABA analogs, and the results validated structure-based design for this target class. "

We use DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), synthetic binding proteins based on the Ankyrin-repeat protein scaffold, as binding units. Their ease of in vitro selection, high production yield and stability make them ideal specificity-conferring building blocks for the design of more complex constructs. C- and N-terminal DARPin capping repeats were re-designed to be joined by a shared helix in such a way that rigid connector modules are formed. This allows us to join two or more DARPins in predefined geometries without compromising their binding affinities and specificities. Nine connector modules with distinct geometries were designed; for eight of these we were able to confirm the structure by X-ray crystallography, while only one did not crystallize. The bispecific constructs were all able to bind both target proteins simultaneously."

Here we analyzed the same cryo-EM datasets with a focus on channel conformational dynamics to elucidate structural correlates pertinent to ligand interactions and channel gating. We found pharmacological inhibitors and ATP enrich a channel conformation in which the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain is closely associated with the transmembrane domain, while depleting one where the Kir6.2 cytoplasmic domain is extended away into the cytoplasm. This conformational change remodels a network of intra- and inter-subunit interactions as well as the ATP and PIP <sub>2 </sub> binding pockets. The structures resolved key contacts between the distal N-terminus of Kir6.2 and SUR1's ABC module involving residues implicated in channel function and showed a SUR1 residue, K134, participates in PIP <sub>2 </sub> binding.

Unlike other Rex proteins that regulate aerobic respiration, RSP controls ethanol fermentation in the obligate anaerobe Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus JW200(T). It is also found in other anaerobic microorganisms. Here we present the crystal structures of apo-RSP, RSP/NADH and RSP/NAD(+)/DNA, which are the first structures of Rex-family members from an obligate anaerobe. RSP functions as a homodimer. It assumes an open conformation when bound to the operator DNA and a closed conformation when not DNA-bound. The DNA binds to the N-terminal winged-helix domain and the dinucleotide, either reduced or oxidized, binds to the C-terminal Rossmann-fold domain. The two distinct orientations of nicotinamide ring, anti in NADH and syn in NAD(+), give rise to two sets of protein-ligand interactions. Consequently, NADH binding makes RSP into a closed conformation, which does not bind to DNA. Both the conserved residues and the DNA specificity of RSP show a number of variations from those of the aerobic Rex, reflecting different structural bases for redox-sensing by the anaerobic and aerobic Rex-family members.

Our structural research, complemented by binding assays and global protein stability (GPS) analyses, demonstrates that FEM1A/C and FEM1B selectively target distinct classes of Arg/C-degrons. Overall, our study not only sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying Arg/C-degron recognition for precise control of substrate turnover, but also provides valuable information for development of chemical probes for selectively regulating proteostasis."

A pyrrole hit with a binding constant of 1 mM formed the basis of the design and synthesis of a focused library of compounds that resulted in the rapid identification of a lead compound that inhibited DNA gyrase with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 3 \u03bcM. The potency of the lead compound was further optimized by utilizing iterative X-ray crystallography to yield DNA gyrase inhibitors that also displayed antibacterial activity. Spontaneous mutants were isolated in Staphylococcus aureus by plating on agar plates containing pyrrolamide 4 at the MIC. The resistant variants displayed 4- to 8-fold-increased MIC values relative to the parent strain. DNA sequencing revealed two independent point mutations in the pyrrolamide binding region of the gyrB genes from these variants, supporting the hypothesis that the mode of action of these compounds was inhibition of DNA gyrase. Efficacy of a representative pyrrolamide was demonstrated against Streptococcus pneumoniae in a mouse lung infection model.

PD only accepts primeverose as the glycone substrate, but broadly accepts various aglycones, including 2-phenylethanol, benzyl alcohol, linalool, and geraniol. We determined the crystal structure of PD complexes using highly specific disaccharide amidine inhibitors, N-\u03b2-primeverosylamidines, and revealed the architecture of the active site responsible for substrate specificity. We identified three subsites in the active site: subsite -2 specific for 6-O-\u03b2-d-xylopyranosyl, subsite -1 well conserved among \u03b2-glucosidases and specific for \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl, and wide subsite +1 for hydrophobic aglycone. Glu-470, Ser-473, and Gln-477 act as the specific hydrogen bond donors for 6-O-\u03b2-d-xylopyranosyl in subsite -2. On the other hand, subsite +1 was a large hydrophobic cavity that accommodates various aromatic aglycones. Compared with aglycone-specific \u03b2-glucosidases of the glycoside hydrolase family 1, PD lacks the Trp crucial for aglycone recognition, and the resultant large cavity accepts aglycone and 6-O-\u03b2-d-xylopyranosyl together. PD recognizes the \u03b2-primeverosides in subsites -1 and -2 by hydrogen bonds, whereas the large subsite +1 loosely accommodates various aglycones.

In 25 cases, including eight reported previously, it was possible to determine the crystal structures of the variants. The structures of four variants with double substitutions were also determined. In the majority of cases the \"large-to-small\" substitutions lead to internal cavities. In other cases declivities or channels open to the surface were formed. In some cases the structural changes were minimal (mainchain shifts < or = 0.3 A); in other cases mainchain atoms moved up to 2 A. In the case of Ile 29 --> Ala the structure collapsed to such a degree that the volume of the putative cavity was zero. Crystallographic analysis suggests that the occupancy of the engineered cavities by solvent is usually low. The mutants Val 149 --> Ala (V149A) and Met 6 --> Ala (M6A), however, are exceptions and have, respectively, one and two well-ordered water molecules within the cavity. The Val 149 --> Ala substitution allows the solvent molecule to hydrogen bond to polar atoms that are occluded in the wild-type molecule. Similarly, the replacement of Met 6 with alanine allows the two solvent molecules to hydrogen bond to each other and to polar atoms on the protein. Except for Val 149 --> Ala the loss of stability of all the cavity mutants can be rationalized as a combination of two terms. The first is a constant for a given class of substitution (e.g., -2.1 kcal/mol for all Leu --> Ala substitutions) and can be considered as the difference between the free energy of transfer of leucine and alanine from solvent to the core of the protein. The second term can be considered as the energy cost of forming the cavity and is consistent with a numerical value of 22 cal mol(-1) A(-3). Physically, this term is due to the loss of van der Waal's interactions between the bulky sidechain that is removed and the atoms that form the wall of the cavity. The overall results are consistent with the prior rationalization of Leu --> Ala mutants in T4 lysozyme by Eriksson et al. (Eriksson et al., 1992, Science 255:178-183)."

A crystal of EGPf was previously prepared at pH 9.0 and its structure was determined at an atomic resolution of 1.07\u2005\u00c5. This article reports the crystallization of EGPf at the more physiologically relevant pH of 5.5. Structure determination showed that this new crystal form has the symmetry of space group C2. Two molecules of the enzyme are observed in the asymmetric unit. Crystal packing is weak at pH 5.5 owing to two flexible interfaces between symmetry-related molecules. Comparison of the EGPf structures obtained at pH 9.0 and pH 5.5 reveals a significant conformational difference at the active centre and in the surface loops. The interfaces in the vicinity of the flexible surface loops impact the quality of the EGPf crystal. "

Their ease of in vitro selection, high production yield and stability make them ideal specificity-conferring building blocks for the design of more complex constructs. C- and N-terminal DARPin capping repeats were re-designed to be joined by a shared helix in such a way that rigid connector modules are formed. This allows us to join two or more DARPins in predefined geometries without compromising their binding affinities and specificities. Nine connector modules with distinct geometries were designed; for eight of these we were able to confirm the structure by X-ray crystallography, while only one did not crystallize. The bispecific constructs were all able to bind both target proteins simultaneously."

We delineate the structural basis of this relatively escape-resistant epitope that extends from one end of the receptor binding site (RBS) into the highly conserved CR3022 site. ADG20 can then benefit from high potency through direct competition with ACE2 in the more variable RBS and interaction with the more highly conserved CR3022 site. Importantly, antibodies that are able to target this site generally neutralize a broad range of VOCs, albeit with reduced potency against Omicron. Thus, this conserved and vulnerable site can be exploited for the design of universal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies."

Neutron diffraction studies were conducted using the IBARAKI Biological Crystal Diffractometer with the time-of-flight method. The neutron structure solved at 2.0\u00c5 resolution revealed the protonation states of His88 and the detailed hydrogen-bond network depending on the protonation states of His88. This hydrogen-bond network is composed of Thr75, Trp79, His88, Ser112, Pro113, Thr118-B and four water molecules, and is involved in both monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer interactions, suggesting that the double protonation of His88 by acidification breaks the hydrogen-bond network and causes the destabilization of the TTR tetramer. In addition, the comparison with X-ray structure at pH 4.0 indicated that the protonation occurred to Asp74, His88 and Glu89 at pH 4.0. Our neutron model provides insights into the molecular stability of TTR related to the hydrogen-bond network, the pH sensitivity and the CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O weak hydrogen bond."

Here we present the crystal structures of apo-RSP, RSP/NADH and RSP/NAD(+)/DNA, which are the first structures of Rex-family members from an obligate anaerobe. RSP functions as a homodimer. It assumes an open conformation when bound to the operator DNA and a closed conformation when not DNA-bound. The DNA binds to the N-terminal winged-helix domain and the dinucleotide, either reduced or oxidized, binds to the C-terminal Rossmann-fold domain. The two distinct orientations of nicotinamide ring, anti in NADH and syn in NAD(+), give rise to two sets of protein-ligand interactions. Consequently, NADH binding makes RSP into a closed conformation, which does not bind to DNA. Both the conserved residues and the DNA specificity of RSP show a number of variations from those of the aerobic Rex, reflecting different structural bases for redox-sensing by the anaerobic and aerobic Rex-family members.

In 25 cases, including eight reported previously, it was possible to determine the crystal structures of the variants. The structures of four variants with double substitutions were also determined. In the majority of cases the \"large-to-small\" substitutions lead to internal cavities. In other cases declivities or channels open to the surface were formed. In some cases the structural changes were minimal (mainchain shifts < or = 0.3 A); in other cases mainchain atoms moved up to 2 A. In the case of Ile 29 --> Ala the structure collapsed to such a degree that the volume of the putative cavity was zero. Crystallographic analysis suggests that the occupancy of the engineered cavities by solvent is usually low. The mutants Val 149 --> Ala (V149A) and Met 6 --> Ala (M6A), however, are exceptions and have, respectively, one and two well-ordered water molecules within the cavity. The Val 149 --> Ala substitution allows the solvent molecule to hydrogen bond to polar atoms that are occluded in the wild-type molecule. Similarly, the replacement of Met 6 with alanine allows the two solvent molecules to hydrogen bond to each other and to polar atoms on the protein. Except for Val 149 --> Ala the loss of stability of all the cavity mutants can be rationalized as a combination of two terms. The first is a constant for a given class of substitution (e.g., -2.1 kcal/mol for all Leu --> Ala substitutions) and can be considered as the difference between the free energy of transfer of leucine and alanine from solvent to the core of the protein. The second term can be considered as the energy cost of forming the cavity and is consistent with a numerical value of 22 cal mol(-1) A(-3). Physically, this term is due to the loss of van der Waal's interactions between the bulky sidechain that is removed and the atoms that form the wall of the cavity. The overall results are consistent with the prior rationalization of Leu --> Ala mutants in T4 lysozyme by Eriksson et al. (Eriksson et al., 1992, Science 255:178-183)."

However, identifying initial starting points for PPI stabilizing matter is highly challenging, and chemical optimization is labor-intensive. Inspired by chemical crosslinking and reversible covalent fragment-based drug discovery, we developed an approach that we term \"molecular locks\" to rapidly access molecular glue-like tool compounds. These dual-covalent small molecules reversibly react with a nucleophilic amino acid on each of the partner proteins to dynamically crosslink the protein complex. The PPI between the hub protein 14-3-3 and estrogen-related receptor \u03b3 (ERR\u03b3) was used as a pharmacologically relevant case study. Based on a focused library of dual-reactive small molecules, a molecular glue tool compound was rapidly developed. Biochemical assays and X-ray crystallographic studies validated the ternary covalent complex formation and overall PPI stabilization via dynamic covalent crosslinking. The molecular lock approach is highly selective for the specific 14-3-3/ERR\u03b3 complex, over other 14-3-3 complexes. This selectivity is driven by the interplay of molecular reactivity and molecular recognition of the composite PPI binding interface. The long lifetime of the dual-covalent locks enabled the selective stabilization of the 14-3-3/ERR\u03b3 complex even in the presence of several other competing 14-3-3 clients with higher intrinsic binding affinities. The molecular lock approach enables systematic, selective, and potent stabilization of protein complexes to support molecular glue drug discovery."

DNA sequencing revealed two independent point mutations in the pyrrolamide binding region of the gyrB genes from these variants, supporting the hypothesis that the mode of action of these compounds was inhibition of DNA gyrase.

Deletion of the M-Lip domain in lipin 1 reduces PAP activity, membrane association, and oligomerization, alters subcellular localization, diminishes acceleration of adipocyte differentiation, but does not affect transcriptional co-activation.

NMR structure determination further reveals that despite their primary sequence dissimilarity, the NH2-terminal portions of both OCRL and INPP5B contain a PH domain. The novel clathrin-binding site in OCRL maps to an unusual clathrin-box motif located in a loop of the PH domain, whose mutations reduce recruitment efficiency of OCRL to coated pits.

The SIFV nucleocapsid is formed by a heterodimer of two homologous proteins and is membrane enveloped, while SSRV1 has a nucleocapsid formed by a homodimer and is not enveloped. In both, the capsid proteins wrap around the DNA and maintain it in an A-form. We suggest that the A-form is due to both a nonspecific desolvation of the DNA by the protein, and a specific coordination of the DNA phosphate groups by positively charged residues. We extend these observations by comparisons with four other archaeal filamentous viruses whose structures we have previously determined, and show that all 10 capsid proteins (from four heterodimers and two homodimers) have obvious structural homology while sequence similarity can be nonexistent. This arises from most capsid residues not being under any strong selective pressure. The inability to detect homology at the sequence level arises from the sampling of viruses in this part of the biosphere being extremely sparse. Comparative structural and genomic analyses suggest that nonenveloped archaeal viruses have evolved from enveloped viruses by shedding the membrane, indicating that this trait may be relatively easily lost during virus evolution."

It is an important target of adamantane-family antiviral drugs, but drug resistance has become a critical problem. Two different sites for drug interaction have been proposed. One is a lipid-facing pocket between 2 adjacent transmembrane helices (around Asp-44), at which the drug binds and inhibits proton conductance allosterically. The other is inside the pore (around Ser-31), at which the drug directly blocks proton passage. Here, we describe structural and functional experiments on the mechanism of drug inhibition and resistance. The solution structure of the S31N drug-resistant mutant of M2, a mutant of the highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1, shows that replacing Ser-31 with Asn has little effect on the structure of the channel pore, but dramatically reduces drug binding to the allosteric site. Mutagenesis and liposomal proton flux assays show that replacing the key residue (Asp-44) in the lipid-facing binding pocket with Ala has a dramatic effect on drug sensitivity, but that the channel remains fully drug sensitive when replacing Ser-31 with Ala. Chemical cross-linking studies indicate an inverse correlation between channel stability and drug resistance. The lipid-facing pocket contains residues from 2 adjacent channel-forming helices. Therefore, it is present only when the helices are tightly packed in the closed conformation. Thus, drug-resistant mutants impair drug binding by destabilizing helix-helix assembly."

To structurally probe their mode of PBP2 inhibition as well as investigate why  <i>P. aeruginosa </i> PBP2 is less susceptible to inhibition by \u03b2-lactam antibiotics compared to the  <i>Escherichia coli </i> PBP2, we determined the crystal structure of  <i>P. aeruginosa </i> PBP2 in complex with WCK 5153.

Their ease of in vitro selection, high production yield and stability make them ideal specificity-conferring building blocks for the design of more complex constructs. C- and N-terminal DARPin capping repeats were re-designed to be joined by a shared helix in such a way that rigid connector modules are formed. This allows us to join two or more DARPins in predefined geometries without compromising their binding affinities and specificities.

The SIFV nucleocapsid is formed by a heterodimer of two homologous proteins and is membrane enveloped, while SSRV1 has a nucleocapsid formed by a homodimer and is not enveloped. In both, the capsid proteins wrap around the DNA and maintain it in an A-form. We suggest that the A-form is due to both a nonspecific desolvation of the DNA by the protein, and a specific coordination of the DNA phosphate groups by positively charged residues. We extend these observations by comparisons with four other archaeal filamentous viruses whose structures we have previously determined, and show that all 10 capsid proteins (from four heterodimers and two homodimers) have obvious structural homology while sequence similarity can be nonexistent. This arises from most capsid residues not being under any strong selective pressure. The inability to detect homology at the sequence level arises from the sampling of viruses in this part of the biosphere being extremely sparse. Comparative structural and genomic analyses suggest that nonenveloped archaeal viruses have evolved from enveloped viruses by shedding the membrane, indicating that this trait may be relatively easily lost during virus evolution."

Several ways of utilizing structural information to guide the inhibitor assembly have been explored to date. One of the approaches, application of interligand Overhauser effect (ILOE) observations, is of particular interest, as it does not require the availability of a three-dimensional protein structure and is an NMR-based method that can be applied to targets that cannot be observed directly because of their size. Fragments, as small and often hydrophobic molecules, suffer from problems including compound aggregation in an aqueous environment and nonspecific binding contributions, especially when screened at higher concentrations suitable for ILOE observations. Here we report how this problem can be overcome by applying a step-by-step iterative procedure that includes the application of optimized probe molecules with known binding modes to elucidate the unknown binding modes of fragments. An enzyme substrate with well-characterized binding was used as a starting point, and the relative binding modes of modified fragments derived from ILOE observations were used to guide the fragment linking, leading to a potent inhibitor of our model system, Mycobacterium tuberculosis pantothenate synthetase, a potential drug target. We have supported our NMR data with crystal structures, thus establishing the guidelines for optimizing the ILOE observations.

Here we report the solution structures of the A-domain of both proteins, solved by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and a characterization of the dynamics of the A-domain of ATP7A.

The loop is rigid, suggesting that the catalytic step does not require substantial structural flexibility or rearrangements. The present structures were useful to rationalize the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations.

To elucidate the mechanism of substrate stereospecificity, crystal structures of D-THA DH were determined in complex with various ligands, such as an inhibitor (D-erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate (D-EHA)), a substrate (L-EHA), and the reaction intermediate (2-amino maleic acid). The C (\u03b2) -OH of L-EHA occupied a position close to the active-site Mg(2+), clearly indicating a possibility of metal-assisted C (\u03b2) -OH elimination from the substrate. In contrast, the C (\u03b2) -OH of an inhibitor was bound far from the active-site Mg(2+). This suggests that the substrate specificity of D-THA DH is determined by the orientation of the C (\u03b2) -OH at the active site, whose spatial arrangement is compatible with the 3R configuration of 3-hydroxyaspartate. We also report an optically pure synthesis of L-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (L-THA) and D-EHA, promising intermediates for the synthesis of \u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate, by using a purified D-THA DH as a biocatalyst for the resolution of racemic DL-threo-3-hydroxyaspartate (DL-THA) and DL-erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate (DL-EHA).

By burying the hairpin loop, which is required for formation of active receptor dimers, the tether contact was thought to prevent constitutive activation of EGFR and its homologs. Amino-acid substitutions at key sites within the tether contact region fail to result in constitutively active receptors however. We report here the 2.5 \u00c5 crystal structure of the N-terminal three extracellular domains of ErbB4, which bind ligand but lack domain IV and thus the tether contact. This ErbB4 fragment nonetheless adopts a domain arrangement very similar to the arrangement adopted in the presence of the tether suggesting that regions in addition to the tether contribute to maintaining this conformation and inactivity in the absence of the tether contact. We suggest that the tether conformation may have evolved to prevent crosstalk between different EGFR homologs and thus allow diversification of EGFR and its homologs."

To explore the biological significance of chemokine aggregation, nonaggregating variants were sought. The phenotypes of 105 hMIP-1alpha variants generated by systematic mutagenesis and expression in yeast were determined. hMIP-1alpha residues Asp26 and Glu66 were critical to the self-association process. Substitution at either residue resulted in the formation of essentially homogenous tetramers at 0.5 mg/ml. Substitution of identical or analogous residues in homologous positions in both hMIP-1beta and RANTES demonstrated that they were also critical to aggregation. Our analysis suggests that a single charged residue at either position 26 or 66 is insufficient to support extensive aggregation and that two charged residues must be present. Solution of the three-dimensional NMR structure of hMIP-1alpha has enabled comparison of these residues in hMIP-1beta and RANTES. Aggregated and disaggregated forms of hMIP-1alpha, hMIP-1beta, and RANTES generally have equivalent G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated biological potencies. We have therefore generated novel reagents to evaluate the role of hMIP-1alpha, hMIP-1beta, and RANTES aggregation in vitro and in vivo. The disaggregated chemokines retained their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitory activities. Surprisingly, high concentrations of RANTES, but not disaggregated RANTES variants, enhanced infection of cells by both M- and T-tropic HIV isolates/strains.

The substrates transported by different ABC transporters are diverse, ranging from small ions to large proteins. Although crystal structures of several ABC transporters are available, a structural basis for substrate recognition is still lacking. For the Escherichia coli maltose transport system, the selectivity of sugar binding to maltose-binding protein (MBP), the periplasmic binding protein, does not fully account for the selectivity of sugar transport. To obtain a molecular understanding of this observation, we determined the crystal structures of the transporter complex MBP-MalFGK2 bound with large malto-oligosaccharide in two different conformational states. In the pretranslocation structure, we found that the transmembrane subunit MalG forms two hydrogen bonds with malto-oligosaccharide at the reducing end. In the outward-facing conformation, the transmembrane subunit MalF binds three glucosyl units from the nonreducing end of the sugar. These structural features explain why modified malto-oligosaccharides are not transported by MalFGK2 despite their high binding affinity to MBP.

Anti-CRISPRs are remarkably diverse in sequence, structure, and functional mechanism; thus, structural and mechanistic investigations of anti-CRISPRs continue to yield exciting new insights. In this study, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of AcrIE2, an anti-CRISPR that inhibits the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Guided by the structure, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify key residues that are required for AcrIE2 function. Using affinity purification experiments, we found that AcrIE2 binds the type I-E CRISPR-Cas complex (Cascade). In vivo transcriptional assays, in which Cascade was targeted to promoter regions, demonstrated that Cascade still binds to DNA in the presence of AcrIE2. This is the first instance of a type I anti-CRISPR that binds to a CRISPR-Cas complex but does not prevent DNA-binding. Another unusual property of AcrIE2 is that the effect of Cascade:AcrIE2 complex binding to promoter regions varied depending on the position of the binding site. Most surprisingly, Cascade:AcrIE2 binding led to transcriptional activation in some cases rather than repression, which did not occur when Cascade alone bound to the same sites. We conclude that AcrIE2 operates through a distinct mechanism compared to other type I anti-CRISPRs. While AcrIE2 does not prevent Cascade from binding DNA, it likely blocks subsequent recruitment of the Cas3 nuclease to Cascade thereby preventing DNA cleavage."

Selective inhibition of calpain-I has proved difficult as most compounds target the active site and inhibit a broad spectrum of cysteine proteases as well as other calpain isoforms. Selective inhibitors might not only be potential drugs but should act as tools to explore the physiological and pathophysiological roles of calpain-I. \u03b1-Mercaptoacrylic acid based calpain inhibitors are potent, cell permeable and selective inhibitors of calpain-I and calpain-II. These inhibitors target the calcium binding domain PEF(S) of calpain-I and -II. Here X-ray diffraction analysis of co-crystals of PEF(S) revealed that the disulfide form of an \u03b1-mercaptoacrylic acid bound within a hydrophobic groove that is also targeted by a calpastatin inhibitory region and made a greater number of favourable interactions with the protein than the reduced sulfhydryl form. Measurement of the inhibitory potency of the \u03b1-mercaptoacrylic acids and X-ray crystallography revealed that the IC <sub>50 </sub> values decreased significantly on oxidation as a consequence of the stereo-electronic properties of disulfide bonds that restrict rotation around the S-S bond. Consequently, thioether analogues inhibited calpain-I with potencies similar to those of the free sulfhydryl forms of \u03b1-mercaptoacrylic acids."

Haem uptake by pathogenic bacteria is facilitated by the membrane-integrated haem importer, which belongs to the type II ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Here we present crystal structures of Burkholderia cenocepacia haem importer BhuUV complexed with the periplasmic haem-binding protein BhuT and in the absence of BhuT. The transmembrane helices of these structures show an inward-facing conformation, in which the cytoplasmic gate of the haem translocation pathway is completely open. Since this conformation is found in both the haem- and nucleotide-free form, the structure of BhuUV-T provides the post-translocation state and the missing piece in the transport cycle of the type II importer. Structural comparison with the outward-facing conformation reported for the haem importer ortholog HmuUV from Yersenia pestis gives mechanistic insights into conformational transitions and haem secretion during the haem transport cycle."

TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and Phe-2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity."

An accepted catalytic model of pyrophosphatase shows that a water molecule activated by two divalent cations (M1 and M2) within the catalytic center can attack pyrophosphate in an S <sub>N </sub>2 mechanism and thus hydrolyze the molecule. However, our co-crystal structure of  <i>Acinetobacter baumannii </i> pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate shows that a water molecule from the solvent may, in fact, be the actual catalytic water. In the co-crystal structure of the wild-type pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate, the electron density of the catalytic centers of each monomer are different from one another. This indicates that pyrophosphates in the catalytic center are dynamic. Our mass spectroscopy results have identified a highly conserved lysine residue (Lys30) in the catalytic center that is phosphorylated, indicating that the enzyme could form a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate during hydrolysis. Mutation of Lys30 to Arg abolished the activity of the enzyme. In the structure of the apo wild type enzyme, we observed that a Na <sup>+ </sup> ion is coordinated by residues within a loop proximal to the catalytic center. Therefore, we mutated three key residues within the loop (K143R, P147G, and K149R) and determined Na <sup>+ </sup> and K <sup>+ </sup>-induced inhibition on their activities. Compared to the wild type enzyme, P147G is most sensitive to these cations, whereas K143R was inactive and K149R showed no change in activity. These data indicate that monovalent cations could play a role in down-regulating pyrophosphatase activity in vivo.

C172 lies near the C terminus, outside the active site. It is not established whether structural changes in this region, such as mixed disulfide formation, affect H <sub>2 </sub>O <sub>2 </sub> reactivity. To investigate, we designed mutants to cause minimal (C172S) or substantial (C172D and C172W) structural disruption. Stopped flow kinetics and mass spectrometry showed that mutation to Ser had minimal effect on rates of oxidation and hyperoxidation, whereas Asp and Trp decreased both by \u223c100-fold. To relate to structural changes, we solved the crystal structures of reduced WT and C172S Prdx2. The WT structure is highly similar to that of the published hyperoxidized form. C172S is closely related but more flexible and as demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, a weaker decamer. Size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the C172D and C172W mutants are also weaker decamers than WT, and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis indicated greater flexibility with partially unstructured regions consistent with C-terminal unfolding. We propose that these structural changes around C172 negatively impact the active site geometry to decrease reactivity with H <sub>2 </sub>O <sub>2 </sub>. This is relevant for Prdx turnover as intermediate mixed disulfides with C172 would also be disruptive and could potentially react with peroxides before resolution is complete."

The phenotypes of 105 hMIP-1alpha variants generated by systematic mutagenesis and expression in yeast were determined. hMIP-1alpha residues Asp26 and Glu66 were critical to the self-association process. Substitution at either residue resulted in the formation of essentially homogenous tetramers at 0.5 mg/ml. Substitution of identical or analogous residues in homologous positions in both hMIP-1beta and RANTES demonstrated that they were also critical to aggregation. Our analysis suggests that a single charged residue at either position 26 or 66 is insufficient to support extensive aggregation and that two charged residues must be present. Solution of the three-dimensional NMR structure of hMIP-1alpha has enabled comparison of these residues in hMIP-1beta and RANTES. Aggregated and disaggregated forms of hMIP-1alpha, hMIP-1beta, and RANTES generally have equivalent G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated biological potencies. We have therefore generated novel reagents to evaluate the role of hMIP-1alpha, hMIP-1beta, and RANTES aggregation in vitro and in vivo. The disaggregated chemokines retained their human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibitory activities. Surprisingly, high concentrations of RANTES, but not disaggregated RANTES variants, enhanced infection of cells by both M- and T-tropic HIV isolates/strains.

Our structure determination package, called RDC-PANDA: (RDC-based SSE PAcking with NOEs for Structure Determination and NOE Assignment), consists of three modules: (1) RDC-EXACT: ; (2) PACKER: ; and (3) HANA: (HAusdorff-based NOE Assignment). RDC-EXACT: computes the global optimal solution of backbone dihedral angles for each secondary structure element by exactly solving a system of quartic RDC equations derived by Wang and Donald (Proceedings of the IEEE computational systems bioinformatics conference (CSB), Stanford, CA, 2004a; J Biomol NMR 29(3):223-242, 2004b), and systematically searching over the roots, each of which is a backbone dihedral varphi- or psi-angle consistent with the RDC data. Using a small number of unambiguous inter-SSE NOEs extracted using only chemical shift information, PACKER: performs a systematic search for the core structure, including all SSE backbone conformations. HANA: uses a Hausdorff-based scoring function to measure the similarity between the experimental spectra and the back-computed NOE pattern for each side-chain from a statistically-diverse rotamer library, and drives the selection of optimal position-specific rotamers for filtering ambiguous NOE assignments. Finally, a local minimization approach is used to compute the loops and refine side-chain conformations by fixing the core structure as a rigid body while allowing movement of loops and side-chains. RDC-PANDA: was applied to NMR data for the FF Domain 2 of human transcription elongation factor CA150 (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain interacting protein), human ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-binding zinc finger domain of the human Y-family DNA polymerase Eta (pol eta UBZ), and the human Set2-Rpb1 interacting domain (hSRI).

An accepted catalytic model of pyrophosphatase shows that a water molecule activated by two divalent cations (M1 and M2) within the catalytic center can attack pyrophosphate in an S <sub>N </sub>2 mechanism and thus hydrolyze the molecule. However, our co-crystal structure of  <i>Acinetobacter baumannii </i> pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate shows that a water molecule from the solvent may, in fact, be the actual catalytic water. In the co-crystal structure of the wild-type pyrophosphatase with pyrophosphate, the electron density of the catalytic centers of each monomer are different from one another. This indicates that pyrophosphates in the catalytic center are dynamic. Our mass spectroscopy results have identified a highly conserved lysine residue (Lys30) in the catalytic center that is phosphorylated, indicating that the enzyme could form a phosphoryl enzyme intermediate during hydrolysis. Mutation of Lys30 to Arg abolished the activity of the enzyme. In the structure of the apo wild type enzyme, we observed that a Na <sup>+ </sup> ion is coordinated by residues within a loop proximal to the catalytic center. Therefore, we mutated three key residues within the loop (K143R, P147G, and K149R) and determined Na <sup>+ </sup> and K <sup>+ </sup>-induced inhibition on their activities. Compared to the wild type enzyme, P147G is most sensitive to these cations, whereas K143R was inactive and K149R showed no change in activity. These data indicate that monovalent cations could play a role in down-regulating pyrophosphatase activity in vivo. Overall, our results reveal new aspects of pyrophosphatase catalysis and could assist in the design of specific inhibitors of  <i>Acinetobacter baumannii </i> growth."

Thiosulfate is used for cysteine synthesis in bacteria as an inorganic sulfur source in the global biological sulfur cycle. The crystal structure of YeeE at 2.5-\u00c5 resolution reveals an unprecedented hourglass-like architecture with thiosulfate in the positively charged outer concave side. YeeE is composed of loops and 13 helices including 9 transmembrane \u03b1 helices, most of which show an intramolecular pseudo 222 symmetry. Four characteristic loops are buried toward the center of YeeE and form its central region surrounded by the nine helices. Additional electron density maps and successive molecular dynamics simulations imply that thiosulfate can remain temporally at several positions in the proposed pathway. We propose a plausible mechanism of thiosulfate uptake via three important conserved cysteine residues of the loops along the pathway."

Although LB-100 is widely reported as a specific inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2AC/ <i>PPP2CA:PPP2CB </i>), we could find no experimental evidence in the published literature demonstrating the specific engagement of LB-100 with PP2A  <i>in vitro </i>, in cultured cells, or in animals. Rather, the premise for LB-100 targeting PP2AC is derived from studies that measure phosphate released from a phosphopeptide (K-R-pT-I-R-R) or inferred from the ability of LB-100 to mimic activity previously reported to result from the inhibition of PP2AC by other means. PP2AC and PPP5C share a common catalytic mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that the phosphopeptide used to ascribe LB-100 specificity for PP2A is also a substrate for PPP5C. Inhibition assays using purified enzymes demonstrate that LB-100 is a catalytic inhibitor of both PP2AC and PPP5C. The structure of PPP5C cocrystallized with LB-100 was solved to a resolution of 1.65\u00c5, revealing that the 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarbonyl moiety coordinates with the metal ions and key residues that are conserved in both PP2AC and PPP5C. Cell-based studies revealed some known actions of LB-100 are mimicked by the genetic disruption of  <i>PPP5C </i> These data demonstrate that LB-100 is a catalytic inhibitor of both PP2AC and PPP5C and suggest that the observed antitumor activity might be due to an additive effect achieved by suppressing both PP2A and PPP5C."

The structure has been determined independently by MIR and MAD methods to 2.0 A resolution. The MAD structure was determined largely through automated model building. The protein folds as a TIM barrel beginning with a long N-terminal helix, in contrast to the classic triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) structure, which begins with a beta-strand. A cofactor, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is covalently bound near the C-terminal end of the barrel, the usual active site in TIM-barrel folds. A single-domain monomeric molecule, this yeast protein resembles the N-terminal domain of alanine racemase or ornithine decarboxylase, both of which are two-domain dimeric proteins. The yeast protein has been shown to have amino-acid racemase activity. Although selected as a member of a protein family having no obvious relationship to proteins of known structure, the protein fold turned out to be a well known and widely distributed fold. This points to the need for a more comprehensive base of structural information and better structure-modeling tools before the goal of structure prediction from amino-acid sequences can be realised. In this case, similarity to a known structure allowed inferences to be made about the structure and function of a widely distributed protein family."

A phage display library of 11,200 de novo proteins is designed using the alpha-KTx scaffold of 31 scorpion toxin sequences known or predicted to bind to potassium channels. Mokatoxin-1 (moka1) is isolated by affinity selection on purified target. Moka1 blocks Kv1.3 at nanomolar levels that do not inhibit Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or KCa1.1. As a result, moka1 suppresses CD3/28-induced cytokine secretion by T cells without cross-reactive gastrointestinal hyperactivity. The 3D structure of moka1 rationalizes its specificity and validates the engineering approach, revealing a unique interaction surface supported on an alpha-KTx scaffold.

FF domains occur in tandem arrays of up to six domains, although it is not known whether they adopt higher-order structures. We have used the CA150 FF1+FF2 domains as a model system to examine whether tandem FF domains form higher-order structures in solution using NMR spectroscopy. In the solution structure of FF1 fused to the linker that joins FF1 to FF2, we observed that the highly conserved linker peptide is ordered and forms a helical extension of helix alpha3, suggesting that the interdomain linker might have a role in orientating FF1 relative to FF2. However, examination of the FF1+FF2 domains using relaxation NMR experiments revealed that although these domains are not rigidly orientated relative to one another, they do not tumble independently. Thus, the FF1+FF2 structure conforms to a dumbbell-shape in solution, where the helical interdomain linker maintains distance between the two dynamic FF domains without cementing their relative orientations. This model for FF domain organization within tandem arrays suggests a general mechanism by which individual FF domains can manoeuvre to achieve optimal recognition of flexible binding partners, such as the intrinsically-disordered phosphoCTD."

Binding of monoubiquitinated PCNA and a purified pol \u03b7 fragment containing the UBZ and PIP-box was inhibited by T2AA in vitro. T2AA decreased PCNA/pol \u03b7 and PCNA/REV1 chromatin colocalization but did not inhibit PCNA monoubiquitination, suggesting that T2AA hinders interactions of pol \u03b7 and REV1 with monoubiquitinated PCNA. Interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) are repaired by mechanisms using translesion DNA synthesis that is regulated by monoubiquitinated PCNA. T2AA significantly delayed reactivation of a reporter plasmid containing an ICL. Neutral comet analysis of cells receiving T2AA in addition to cisplatin revealed that T2AA significantly enhanced formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by cisplatin. T2AA promoted colocalized foci formation of phospho-ATM and 53BP1 and up-regulated phospho-BRCA1 in cisplatin-treated cells, suggesting that T2AA increases DSBs.

Our structural and biochemical studies provide mechanistic insights into Fe/S cluster synthesis at the catalytic center defined by the active-site Cys of NFS1 and conserved Cys, Asp, and His residues of ISCU. We assign specific regulatory rather than catalytic roles to ISD11-ACP that link Fe/S cluster synthesis with mitochondrial lipid synthesis and cellular energy status."

We have captured crystallographic snapshots of human glycogenin during its reaction cycle, revealing a dynamic conformational switch between ground and active states mediated by the sugar donor UDP-glucose. This switch includes the ordering of a polypeptide stretch containing Tyr195, and major movement of an approximately 30-residue \"lid\" segment covering the active site. The rearranged lid guides the nascent maltosaccharide chain into the active site in either an intra- or intersubunit mode dependent upon chain length and steric factors and positions the donor and acceptor sugar groups for catalysis. The Thr83Met mutation, which causes glycogen storage disease XV, is conformationally locked in the ground state and catalytically inactive. Our data highlight the conformational plasticity of glycogenin and coexistence of two modes of glucosylation as integral to its catalytic mechanism."

To characterize E-FABP with respect to ligand-binding properties and tertiary structure, we cloned the respective cDNA, overexpressed the protein in Escherichia coli and purified it to homogeneity by a combination of ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatographic steps with a yield of 30 mg/L broth. The purified protein revealed a 5-fold higher affinity for stearic acid than for oleic and arachidonic acids. The crystal structure of recombinant human E-FABP was determined to 2.05 A and refined to an R(factor) of 20.7%. The initial residual electron density maps clearly showed the presence of a ligand, which was identified as endogenous bacterial fatty acid. Within a central cavity of 252 A(3), this ligand is bound in a U-shaped conformation, its carboxyl group interacting with tyrosine 131 and arginines 129 and 109, the latter via an ordered water molecule. The E-FABP crystal structure is unique in the FABP family because of the presence of a disulfide bridge between cysteines 120 and 127 that may be physiologically as well as pathophysiologically relevant. Cysteines 67 and 87 are also in close vicinity but in contrast do not form a disulfide bridge. We postulate that this protein belongs to a particular FABP subfamily whose members share common structural as well as functional features."

TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and Phe-2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity."

Whereas PDI catalyzes native disulfide bond formation by the cooperative action of two mutually facing redox-active sites on folding intermediates bound to the central cleft, ERp46 Trx domains are separated, act independently, and engage in rapid but promiscuous disulfide bond formation during early oxidative protein folding. Thus, multiple PDI family members likely contribute to different stages of oxidative folding and work cooperatively to ensure the efficient production of multi-disulfide proteins in the ER. "

One of the primary challenges when studying PKSs is the high reactivity of their poly-\u03b2-ketone substrates. This has hampered structural and mechanistic characterization of PKS-polyketide complexes, and, as a result, little is known about how PKSs position the unstable substrates for proper catalysis while displaying high levels of regio- and stereospecificity. As a first step toward a general plan to use oxetanes as carbonyl isosteres to broadly interrogate PKS chemistry, we describe the development and application of an oxetane-based PKS substrate mimic. This enabled the first structural determination of the acyl-enzyme intermediate of a ketosynthase (KS) in complex with an inert extender unit mimic. The crystal structure, in combination with molecular dynamics simulations, led to a proposed mechanism for the unique activity of DpsC, the priming ketosynthase for daunorubicin biosynthesis.

The crystals are trigonal, space group P3121 with a=b=78.24 A, c=289.69 A. The asymmetric unit is a homodimer of (alpha/beta)8 barrels and the model has refined to give R-work 19.2 %, R-free (based on 5 % of the data) 23.0 %. PGH resembles the ene-diolate transition state of the physiological substrate dihydroxyacetone phosphate. It is well ordered and bound in a deep polar cavity at the C-terminal end of the (alpha/beta)8 barrel, where it chelates the catalytic zinc ion using hydroxyl and enolate oxygen atoms. Trigonal bipyramidal coordination of the zinc ion is completed by three histidine residues. The complex network of hydrogen bonds at the catalytic centre is required to organise the position of key functional groups and metal ion ligands. A well-defined monovalent cation-binding site is observed following significant re-organisation of loop structures. This assists the formation of a phosphate-binding site on one side of the barrel that tethers PGH in the catalytic site. The positions of functional groups of substrate and putative interactions with key amino acid residues are identified. Knowledge of the complex structure complements the results of spectroscopic and site-directed mutagenesis studies, and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism and substrate specificity of this family of enzymes.

The RTC copies viral RNA for propagation into new virus and for ribosomal transcription of viral proteins. To accomplish these activities, the RTC mechanism must also conform to a large number of imperatives, including RNA over DNA base recognition, basepairing, distinguishing viral and host RNA, production of mRNA that conforms to host ribosome conventions, interfacing with error checking machinery, and evading host immune responses. In addition, the RTC will discontinuously transcribe specific sections of viral RNA to amplify certain proteins over others. Central to SARS-CoV-2 viability, the RTC is therefore dynamic and sophisticated. We have conducted a systematic structural investigation of three components that make up the RTC: Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp12 (also known as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase). We have solved high-resolution crystal structures of the Nsp7/8 complex, providing insight into the interaction between the proteins. We have used small-angle x-ray and neutron solution scattering (SAXS and SANS) on each component individually as pairs and higher-order complexes and with and without RNA. Using size exclusion chromatography and multiangle light scattering-coupled SAXS, we defined which combination of components forms transient or stable complexes. We used contrast-matching to mask specific complex-forming components to test whether components change conformation upon complexation. Altogether, we find that individual Nsp7, Nsp8, and Nsp12 structures vary based on whether other proteins in their complex are present. Combining our crystal structure, atomic coordinates reported elsewhere, SAXS, SANS, and other biophysical techniques, we provide greater insight into the RTC assembly, mechanism, and potential avenues for disruption of the complex and its functions."

TisAFP8 exhibited significantly high antifreeze activity that is comparable with other hyperactive AFPs, despite its close structural and sequence similarity with the moderately active isoform TisAFP6. A series of mutations introduced into the putative ice-binding sites (IBSs) in the \u03b2-sheet and adjacent loop region reduced antifreeze activity. A double-mutant A20T/A212S, which comprises a hydrophobic patch between the \u03b2-sheet and loop region, caused the greatest depression of antifreeze activity of 75%, when compared with that of the wild-type protein. This shows that the loop region is involved in ice binding and hydrophobic residues play crucial functional roles. Additionally, bound waters around the \u03b2-sheet and loop region IBSs were organized into an ice-like network and can be divided into two groups that appear to mediate separately TisAFP and ice. The docking model of TisAFP8 with the basal plane via its loop region IBS reveals a better shape complementarity than that of TisAFP6. In conclusion, we present new insights into the ice-binding mechanism of TisAFP8 by showing that a higher hydrophobicity and better shape complementarity of its IBSs, especially the loop region, may render TisAFP8 hyperactive to ice binding."

In bacteria, they are typically part of FicTA toxin-antitoxin modules that control conserved biochemical processes such as topoisomerase activity, but they have also repeatedly diversified into host-targeted virulence factors. Among these,  <i>Bartonella </i> effector proteins (Beps) comprise a particularly diverse ensemble of FIC domains that subvert various host cellular functions. However, no comprehensive comparative analysis has been performed to infer molecular mechanisms underlying the biochemical and functional diversification of FIC domains in the vast Bep family. Here, we used X-ray crystallography, structural modelling, and phylogenetic analyses to unravel the expansion and diversification of Bep repertoires that evolved in parallel in three  <i>Bartonella </i> lineages from a single ancestral FicTA toxin-antitoxin module. Our analysis is based on 99 non-redundant Bep sequences and nine crystal structures. Inferred from the conservation of the FIC signature motif that comprises the catalytic histidine and residues involved in substrate binding, about half of them represent AMP transferases. A quarter of Beps show a glutamate in a strategic position in the putative substrate binding pocket that would interfere with triphosphate-nucleotide binding but may allow binding of an AMPylated target for deAMPylation or another substrate to catalyze a distinct PTM. The \u03b2-hairpin flap that registers the modifiable target segment to the active site exhibits remarkable structural variability. The corresponding sequences form few well-defined groups that may recognize distinct target proteins. The binding of Beps to promiscuous FicA antitoxins is well conserved, indicating a role of the antitoxin to inhibit enzymatic activity or to serve as a chaperone for the FIC domain before translocation of the Bep into host cells. Taken together, our analysis indicates a remarkable functional plasticity of Beps that is mostly brought about by structural changes in the substrate pocket and the target dock. These findings may guide future structure-function analyses of the highly versatile FIC domains."

Here, we report the crystal structure of the \"as isolated\" form of A. vinosum TsdA to 1.98 \u00c5 resolution and those of several redox states of the enzyme to different resolutions. The protein contains two typical class I c-type cytochrome domains wrapped around two hemes axially coordinated by His(53)/Cys(96) and His(164)/Lys(208). These domains are very similar, suggesting a gene duplication event during evolution. A ligand switch from Lys(208) to Met(209) is observed upon reduction of the enzyme. Cys(96) is an essential residue for catalysis, with the specific activity of the enzyme being completely abolished in several TsdA-Cys(96) variants. TsdA-K208N, K208G, and M209G variants were catalytically active in thiosulfate oxidation as well as in tetrathionate reduction, pointing to heme 2 as the electron exit point.

In this study, we report the first co-crystal structure of SPS from  <i>Thermosynechococcus elongatus </i> with UDP and sucrose-6-phosphate (S6P). Within the catalytic site, the side chains of His158 and Glu331, along with two phosphate groups from UDP, form hydrogen bonds with the four hydroxyl groups of the glucose moiety in S6P. This association causes these four hydroxyl groups to become partially negatively charged, thus promoting formation of the C1 oxocarbenium ion. Breakage of the hydrogen bond between His158 and one of the hydroxyl groups may trigger covalent bond formation between the C1 oxocarbenium ion and the C2 hydroxyl of fructose-6-phosphate. Consistent with our structural model, we observed that two SPS mutants, H158A and E331A, lost all catalytic activity. Moreover, electron density of residues from two loops (loop1 and loop2) in the SPS A-domain was not observed, suggest their dynamic nature. B-factor analysis and molecular dynamics stimulations of the full-length enzyme and A-domain indicate that both loops are crucial for binding and release of substrate and product.

It forms part of a phage DNA protection system and appears to function in vivo as a component of a multienzyme complex called deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) synthetase. We have determined its crystal structure in the presence of the substrate dCMP at 1.6 A resolution. The structure reveals a subunit fold and a dimerization pattern in common with thymidylate synthases, despite low (approximately 20%) sequence identity. Among the residues that form the dCMP binding site, those interacting with the sugar and phosphate are arranged in a configuration similar to the deoxyuridylate binding site of thymidylate synthases. However, the residues interacting directly or indirectly with the cytosine base show a more divergent structure and the presumed folate cofactor binding site is more open. Our structure reveals a water molecule properly positioned near C-6 of cytosine to add to the C-7 methylene intermediate during the last step of hydroxymethylation.

        "caption": "The amidohydrolase superfamily has remarkable functional diversity, with considerable structural and functional annotation of known sequences. In microbes, the recent evolution of several members of this family to catalyze the breakdown of environmental xenobiotics is not well understood. An evolutionary transition from binuclear to mononuclear metal ion coordination at the active sites of these enzymes could produce large functional changes such as those observed in nature, but there are few clear examples available to support this hypothesis. To investigate the role of binuclear-mononuclear active-site transitions in the evolution of new function in this superfamily, we have characterized two recently evolved enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of the synthetic herbicides molinate (MolA) and phenylurea (PuhB). In this work, the crystal structures, mutagenesis, metal ion analysis, and enzyme kinetics of both MolA and PuhB establish that these enzymes utilize a mononuclear active site. However, bioinformatics and structural comparisons reveal that the closest putative ancestor of these enzymes had a binuclear active site, indicating that a binuclear-mononuclear transition has occurred. These proteins may represent examples of evolution modifying the characteristics of existing catalysts to satisfy new requirements, specifically, metal ion rearrangement leading to large leaps in activity that would not otherwise be possible.

Although the benzylic C atom of Ppy is acidic, how its nucleophilicity is further enhanced to become an acceptor for C-methylation has not conclusively been determined. Here, a structural approach is used to address the mechanism of MppJ and to engineer it for new functions. The purified MppJ displays a turquoise colour, implying the presence of a metal ion. The crystal structures reveal MppJ to be the first ferric ion SAM-dependent MT. An additional four structures of binary and ternary complexes illustrate the molecular mechanism for the metal ion-dependent methyltransfer reaction. Overall, MppJ has a nonhaem iron centre that bind, orients and activates the \u03b1-ketoacid substrate and has developed a sandwiched bi-water device to avoid the formation of the unwanted reactive oxo-iron(IV) species during the C-methylation reaction. This discovery further prompted the conversion of the MT into a structurally/functionally unrelated new enzyme. Through stepwise mutagenesis and manipulation of coordination chemistry, MppJ was engineered to perform both Lewis acid-assisted hydration and/or O-methyltransfer reactions to give stereospecific new compounds. This process was validated by six crystal structures. The results reported in this study will facilitate the development and design of new biocatalysts for difficult-to-synthesize biochemicals."

Furthermore, our data indicate thermodynamic coupling between substrate binding and EAL dimerization with the dimerization affinity being increased about 100-fold upon substrate binding. Crystal structures of the YahA-EAL domain determined under various conditions (apo, Mg(2+), cdG\u00b7Ca(2+) complex) confirm structural coupling between the dimer interface and the catalytic center.

The glycosyl content is described by 19 sugar rings attached to Asn-67 and Asn-257. They are localized on the molecular surface away from the conserved active site and show a new glycan of the plant complex type. A hydrogen bond between Gln-126 and Manbeta4 renders the monosaccharide oxygen O-2 sterically inaccessible to accept a xylosyl residue, therefore explaining the new type of the identified plant glycan. The Arg-Gly-Asp sequence, which has been shown to be involved in recognition of a putative cardosin A receptor, was found in a loop between two beta-strands on the molecular surface opposite the active site cleft. Based on the crystal structure, a possible mechanism whereby cardosin A might be orientated at the cell surface of the style to interact with its putative receptor from pollen is proposed.

However, little is known at the atomic level about the hnRNPA2 LCD structure that is involved in those processes and how disease mutations cause structural change. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of the\u00a0hnRNPA2 LCD fibril core and demonstrate its capability to form a reversible hydrogel in vitro containing amyloid-like fibrils. Whereas these fibrils, like pathogenic amyloid, are formed from protein chains stacked into \u03b2-sheets by backbone hydrogen bonds, they display distinct structural differences: the chains are kinked, enabling non-covalent cross-linking of fibrils and disfavoring formation of pathogenic steric zippers. Both reversibility and energetic calculations suggest these fibrils are less stable than pathogenic amyloid. Moreover, the crystal structure of the disease-mutation-containing segment\u00a0(D290V) of hnRNPA2 suggests that the replacement fundamentally alters the fibril structure to a more stable energetic state. These findings illuminate how molecular interactions promote protein fibril networks and how mutation can transform fibril structure from functional to a pathogenic form."

This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant \"2F5-epitope scaffolds\" possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p\u00a0<\u00a00.04), while antibody responses against the graft-as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions-resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation."

However, their efficacy is diminished due to enzyme-mediated covalent modification, which reduces affinity of the drug for the target ribosome. One of the most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzymes in Gram-negative pathogens is the adenylyltransferase ANT(2\u2033)-Ia, which confers resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin. Despite the importance of this enzyme in drug resistance, its structure and molecular mechanism have been elusive. This study describes the structural and mechanistic basis for adenylylation of aminoglycosides by the ANT(2\u2033)-Ia enzyme. ANT(2\u2033)-Ia confers resistance by magnesium-dependent transfer of a nucleoside monophosphate (AMP) to the 2\u2033-hydroxyl of aminoglycoside substrates containing a 2-deoxystreptamine core. The catalyzed reaction follows a direct AMP transfer mechanism from ATP to the substrate antibiotic. Central to catalysis is the coordination of two Mg(2+) ions, positioning of the modifiable substrate ring, and the presence of a catalytic base (Asp86). Comparative structural analysis revealed that ANT(2\u2033)-Ia has a two-domain structure with an N-terminal active-site architecture that is conserved among other antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases, including Lnu(A), LinB, ANT(4')-Ia, ANT(4\u2033)-Ib, and ANT(6)-Ia. There is also similarity between the nucleotidyltransferase fold of ANT(2\u2033)-Ia and DNA polymerase \u03b2. This similarity is consistent with evolution from a common ancestor, with the nucleotidyltransferase fold having adapted for activity against chemically distinct molecules. IMPORTANCE \u2002: To successfully manage the threat associated with multidrug-resistant infectious diseases, innovative therapeutic strategies need to be developed. One such approach involves the enhancement or potentiation of existing antibiotics against resistant strains of bacteria. The reduction in clinical usefulness of the aminoglycosides is a particular problem among Gram-negative human pathogens, since there are very few therapeutic options for infections caused by these organisms. In order to successfully circumvent or inhibit the activity of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and to thus rejuvenate the activity of the aminoglycoside antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens, structural and mechanistic information is crucial. This study reveals the structure of a clinically prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzyme [ANT(2\u2033)-Ia] and depicts the molecular basis underlying modification of antibiotic substrates. Combined, these findings provide the groundwork for the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors against antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases."

(2S,3S)-\u03b2-Methylphenylalanine, a nonproteinogenic amino acid, is a building unit of the glycopeptide antibiotic mannopeptimycin. The gene product of mppJ from the mannopeptimycin-biosynthetic gene cluster is the MT that methylates the benzylic C atom of phenylpyruvate (Ppy) to give \u03b2MePpy. Although the benzylic C atom of Ppy is acidic, how its nucleophilicity is further enhanced to become an acceptor for C-methylation has not conclusively been determined. Here, a structural approach is used to address the mechanism of MppJ and to engineer it for new functions. The purified MppJ displays a turquoise colour, implying the presence of a metal ion. The crystal structures reveal MppJ to be the first ferric ion SAM-dependent MT. An additional four structures of binary and ternary complexes illustrate the molecular mechanism for the metal ion-dependent methyltransfer reaction. Overall, MppJ has a nonhaem iron centre that bind, orients and activates the \u03b1-ketoacid substrate and has developed a sandwiched bi-water device to avoid the formation of the unwanted reactive oxo-iron(IV) species during the C-methylation reaction. This discovery further prompted the conversion of the MT into a structurally/functionally unrelated new enzyme. Through stepwise mutagenesis and manipulation of coordination chemistry, MppJ was engineered to perform both Lewis acid-assisted hydration and/or O-methyltransfer reactions to give stereospecific new compounds. This process was validated by six crystal structures. The results reported in this study will facilitate the development and design of new biocatalysts for difficult-to-synthesize biochemicals."

However, C. glutamicum has an isoform (Cg1261) of LOG that contains an extended N-terminal region compared to those of known LOGs, and this type of isoforms are also found in a variety of organisms. Nevertheless, these proteins are considered as lysine decarboxylases, without their functional characterization. To investigate the function of Cg1261, we determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 1.95\u2009\u00c5. Unlike known dimeric LOGs, Cg1261 was found to form a hexamer. The overall shape of the hexamer resembles a trillium flower, in which a twisted dimer constitutes each petal. The dimeric petal is well superposed with known LOG dimers, and its active site conformation is similar to those of LOG dimers, suggesting that the hexameric LOG-like protein also acts as a LOG. Biochemical and in vivo cytokinin production studies on Cg1261 confirms that Cg1261 functions as a cytokinin-activating protein. Phylogenetic tree analysis using 123 LOG-like proteins suggest that the LOG-like proteins can be categorized to the dimeric type-I LOG and the hexameric type-II LOG."

The injection of mixed (GlcN)2-7 into the fifth instar larvae of the insect Ostrinia furnacalis resulted in 85% of the larvae being arrested at the larval stage and death after 10 days, also suggesting that (GlcN)2-7 might inhibit OfChtI in vivo. Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of OfChtI (OfChtI-CAD) complexed with (GlcN)5,6 were obtained at resolutions of 2.0 \u00c5. These structures, together with mutagenesis and thermodynamic analysis, suggested that the inhibition was strongly related to the interaction between the -1 GlcN residue of the inhibitor and the catalytic Glu(148) of the enzyme. Structure-based comparison showed that the fully deacetylated chitooligosaccharides mimic the substrate chitooligosaccharides by binding to the active cleft. This work first reports the inhibitory activity and proposed inhibitory mechanism of fully deacetylated chitooligosaccharides.

        "caption": "The aminoglycosides are highly effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. However, their efficacy is diminished due to enzyme-mediated covalent modification, which reduces affinity of the drug for the target ribosome. One of the most prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzymes in Gram-negative pathogens is the adenylyltransferase ANT(2\u2033)-Ia, which confers resistance to gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin. Despite the importance of this enzyme in drug resistance, its structure and molecular mechanism have been elusive. This study describes the structural and mechanistic basis for adenylylation of aminoglycosides by the ANT(2\u2033)-Ia enzyme. ANT(2\u2033)-Ia confers resistance by magnesium-dependent transfer of a nucleoside monophosphate (AMP) to the 2\u2033-hydroxyl of aminoglycoside substrates containing a 2-deoxystreptamine core. The catalyzed reaction follows a direct AMP transfer mechanism from ATP to the substrate antibiotic. Central to catalysis is the coordination of two Mg(2+) ions, positioning of the modifiable substrate ring, and the presence of a catalytic base (Asp86). Comparative structural analysis revealed that ANT(2\u2033)-Ia has a two-domain structure with an N-terminal active-site architecture that is conserved among other antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases, including Lnu(A), LinB, ANT(4')-Ia, ANT(4\u2033)-Ib, and ANT(6)-Ia. There is also similarity between the nucleotidyltransferase fold of ANT(2\u2033)-Ia and DNA polymerase \u03b2. This similarity is consistent with evolution from a common ancestor, with the nucleotidyltransferase fold having adapted for activity against chemically distinct molecules. IMPORTANCE \u2002: To successfully manage the threat associated with multidrug-resistant infectious diseases, innovative therapeutic strategies need to be developed. One such approach involves the enhancement or potentiation of existing antibiotics against resistant strains of bacteria. The reduction in clinical usefulness of the aminoglycosides is a particular problem among Gram-negative human pathogens, since there are very few therapeutic options for infections caused by these organisms. In order to successfully circumvent or inhibit the activity of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, and to thus rejuvenate the activity of the aminoglycoside antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens, structural and mechanistic information is crucial. This study reveals the structure of a clinically prevalent aminoglycoside resistance enzyme [ANT(2\u2033)-Ia] and depicts the molecular basis underlying modification of antibiotic substrates. Combined, these findings provide the groundwork for the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors against antibiotic nucleotidyltransferases."

We have solved a series of crystal structures for the human HHIP ectodomain and Desert hedgehog (DHH) in isolation, as well as HHIP in complex with DHH (HHIP-DHH) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (HHIP-Shh), with and without Ca2+. The interaction determinants, confirmed by biophysical studies and mutagenesis, reveal previously uncharacterized and distinct functions for the Hh Zn2+ and Ca2+ binding sites--functions that may be common to all vertebrate Hh proteins. Zn2+ makes a key contribution to the Hh-HHIP interface, whereas Ca2+ is likely to prevent electrostatic repulsion between the two proteins, suggesting an important modulatory role. This interplay of several metal binding sites suggests a tuneable mechanism for regulation of Hh signaling."

We identified the apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 as a target that interacts with Cdu1 and is stabilized by deubiquitination at the chlamydial inclusion. A chlamydial transposon insertion mutant in the Cdu1-encoding gene exhibited increased Mcl-1 and inclusion ubiquitination and reduced Mcl-1 stabilization. Additionally, inactivation of Cdu1 led to increased sensitivity of  <i>C. trachomatis </i> for IFN\u03b3 and impaired infection in mice.

The deflection angles of the C-terminal domain are not only related to the occupation but also the type of bound substrates in the adjacent active site pocket.

In addition, our results provide new mechanistic insights into how phosphorylation of UBAN would regulate the ubiquitin-binding ability of OPTN and how disease-associated mutations in the OPTN UBAN domain disrupt its interaction with ubiquitin.

Membrane targeting and disruption is a crucial function of\u00a0many defensins, however the precise mechanism remains unclear. Certain plant defensins form dimers that specifically bind the membrane phospholipids phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, thereby triggering the assembly of defensin-lipid oligomers that permeabilize cell membranes. To understand this permeabilization mechanism, here we determine the crystal structure of the plant defensin NaD1 bound to PA. The structure reveals a 20-mer that adopts a concave sheet- or carpet-like topology where NaD1 dimers form one face and PA acyl chains form the other face of the sheet. Furthermore, we show that Arg39 is critical for PA binding, oligomerization and fungal cell killing. These findings identify a putative defensin-phospholipid membrane attack configuration that supports a longstanding proposed carpet mode of membrane disruption."

Discovery of new GHs with improved kinetic parameters or more tolerant substrate-binding sites could increase the efficiency of renewable bioenergy production even further. GH5 has over 50 subfamilies exhibiting selectivities for reaction with \u03b2-(1,4)-linked oligo- and polysaccharides. Among these, subfamily 4 (GH5_4) contains numerous broad-selectivity endoglucanases that hydrolyze cellulose, xyloglucan, and mixed-linkage glucans. We previously surveyed the whole subfamily and found over 100 new broad-specificity endoglucanases, although the structural origins of broad specificity remained unclear. A mechanistic understanding of GH5_4 substrate specificity would help inform the best protein design strategies and the most appropriate industrial application of broad-specificity endoglucanases. Here we report structures of 10 new GH5_4 enzymes from cellulolytic microbes and characterize their substrate selectivity using normalized reducing sugar assays and MS. We found that GH5_4 enzymes have the highest catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of xyloglucan, glucomannan, and soluble \u03b2-glucans, with opportunistic secondary reactions on cellulose, mannan, and xylan. The positions of key aromatic residues determine the overall reaction rate and breadth of substrate tolerance, and they contribute to differences in oligosaccharide cleavage patterns. Our new composite model identifies several critical structural features that confer broad specificity and may be readily engineered into existing industrial enzymes. We demonstrate that GH5_4 endoglucanases can have broad specificity without sacrificing high activity, making them a valuable addition to the biomass deconstruction toolset."

This conformationally flexible region of gp41 assumes mostly helical conformations but adopts a kinked, extended structure when bound by antibody 2F5. Computational techniques were employed to transplant the 2F5 epitope into select acceptor scaffolds. The resultant \"2F5-epitope scaffolds\" possessed nanomolar affinity for antibody 2F5 and a range of epitope flexibilities and antigenic specificities. Crystallographic characterization of the epitope scaffold with highest affinity and antigenic discrimination confirmed good to near perfect attainment of the target conformation for the gp41 molecular graft in free and 2F5-bound states, respectively. Animals immunized with 2F5-epitope scaffolds showed levels of graft-specific immune responses that correlated with graft flexibility (p\u00a0<\u00a00.04), while antibody responses against the graft-as dissected residue-by-residue with alanine substitutions-resembled more closely those of 2F5 than sera elicited with flexible or cyclized peptides, a resemblance heightened by heterologous prime-boost. Lastly, crystal structures of a gp41 peptide in complex with monoclonal antibodies elicited by the 2F5-epitope scaffolds revealed that the elicited antibodies induce gp41 to assume its 2F5-recognized shape. Epitope scaffolds thus provide a means to elicit antibodies that recognize a predetermined target shape and sequence, even if that shape is transient in nature, and a means by which to dissect factors influencing such elicitation."

Here, we used an improved 2-dimensional NMR method coupled with a new protocol for structural refinement by low temperature simulated annealing to characterize the solution structure of these kerain-derived antimicrobial peptides (KAMPs). Two specific KAMPs in complex with membrane mimicking sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles displayed amphipathic conformations with only local bends and turns, and a central 10-residue glycine-rich hydrophobic strip that is central to bactericidal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-\u03b1\u03b2 structure for human antimicrobial peptides. Direct observation of  <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i> and  <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i> by scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that KAMPs deformed bacterial cell envelopes and induced pore formation. Notably, in competitive binding experiments, KAMPs demonstrated binding affinities to LPS and LTA that did not correlate with their bactericidal activities, suggesting peptide-LPS and peptide-LTA interactions are less important in their mechanisms of action. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of KAMPs-bacterial factor complexes indicated that membrane surface lipoprotein SlyB and intracellular machineries NQR sodium pump and ribosomes are potential molecular targets for the peptides.

One of these surfaces is critical for both homodimerization- and kinase-triggered allosteric activations.

Assignment of the resonances arising from the heme propionate carbons in ferricytochrome b5 was carried out by a combination of one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments. Titrations of [13C]heme-labeled OM cytochrome b5 with horse heart cytochrome c were carried out in order to monitor the resonances arising from the heme propionate carbonyl carbons in OM cytochrome b5. The results from these titrations clearly show that only the heme propionate located on the exposed heme edge in OM cytochrome b5 participates in the electrostatic stabilization of the complex between OM cytochrome b5 and horse heart cytochrome c. Similar experiments carried out monitoring 13C resonances arising from several other heme substituents demonstrated that the stoichiometry of the complex is 1:1. A conditional binding constant, K which equals 3.8 x 10(4) +/- 1.4 x 10(4) at mu = 0.02 M, was obtained for the formation of the complex by fitting the binding curves obtained experimentally to a model based on this stoichiometry. The X-ray crystal structure of rat liver OM cytochrome b5 solved to 2.7 A resolution shows that the structures of bovine liver microsomal cytochrome b5 and rat liver OM cytochrome b5 are almost identical when compared at medium resolution. The similarity between the two structures, combined with the findings that only the heme propionate located on the exposed heme edge of OM cytochrome b5 participates in the electrostatic binding to cytochrome c and that the stability of this complex is similar to that measured for the association between microsomal cytochrome b5 and cytochrome c, clearly indicates that the site of interaction on OM cytochrome b5 is almost identical to the one elucidated for microsomal cytochrome b5. It is therefore possible to conclude that the large body of information gathered by many investigators for the nonphysiological interaction between microsomal cytochrome b5 and cytochrome c (recently reviewed) [Mauk, A.

The OIH-1 structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at 1.25 A resolution. OIH-1 has evolved to be an extremely halotolerant beta-lactamase capable of hydrolyzing its substrates in the presence of NaCl at saturating concentration. Not only is this the most highly halotolerant bacterial enzyme structure known to date, it is also the highest resolution halophilic protein structure yet determined. Evolution of OIH-1 in the salinity of the ocean has resulted in a molecular surface that is coated with acidic residues, a marked difference from beta-lactamases of terrestrial sources. OIH-1 is the first example of an antibiotic-resistance enzyme that has evolved in the depths of the ocean in isolation from clinical selection and gives us an extraordinary glimpse into protein evolution under extreme conditions. It represents evidence for the existence of a reservoir of antibiotic-resistance enzymes in nature among microbial populations from deep oceanic sources."

The crystal structure of rice (Oryza sativa) isoform 2 phospholipase A(2) has been determined to 2.0 A resolution using sulfur SAD phasing, and shows that the class XIb phospholipases have a unique structure compared with other secreted PLA(2)s. The N-terminal half of the chain contains mainly loop structure, including the conserved Ca(2+)-binding loop, but starts with a short 3(10)-helix and also includes two short anti-parallel beta-strands. The C-terminal half is folded into three anti-parallel alpha-helices, of which the two first are also present in other secreted PLA(2)s and contain the conserved catalytic histidine and calcium liganding aspartate residues. The structure is stabilized by six disulfide bonds. The water structure around the calcium ion binding site suggests the involvement of a second water molecule in the mechanism for hydrolysis, the water-assisted calcium-coordinate oxyanion mechanism. The octanoate molecule in the complex structure is bound in a hydrophobic pocket, which extends to the likely membrane interface and is proposed to model the binding of the product fatty acid. Due to the differences in structure, the suggested surface for binding to the membrane has a different morphology in the rice PLA(2) compared with other phospholipases."

It is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate of fatty acid synthesis, and it responds to OMM curvature and lipid characteristics, which reflect long term nutrient/hormone availability. Here, we show that the N-terminal regulatory domain (N) of CPT1A can adopt two complex amphiphilic structural states, termed N\u03b1 and N\u03b2, that interchange in a switch-like manner in response to offered binding surface curvature. Structure-based site-directed mutageneses of native CPT1A suggest N\u03b1 to be inhibitory and N\u03b2 to be noninhibitory, with the relative N\u03b1/N\u03b2 ratio setting the prevalent malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme.

Discovery of new GHs with improved kinetic parameters or more tolerant substrate-binding sites could increase the efficiency of renewable bioenergy production even further. GH5 has over 50 subfamilies exhibiting selectivities for reaction with \u03b2-(1,4)-linked oligo- and polysaccharides. Among these, subfamily 4 (GH5_4) contains numerous broad-selectivity endoglucanases that hydrolyze cellulose, xyloglucan, and mixed-linkage glucans. We previously surveyed the whole subfamily and found over 100 new broad-specificity endoglucanases, although the structural origins of broad specificity remained unclear. A mechanistic understanding of GH5_4 substrate specificity would help inform the best protein design strategies and the most appropriate industrial application of broad-specificity endoglucanases. Here we report structures of 10 new GH5_4 enzymes from cellulolytic microbes and characterize their substrate selectivity using normalized reducing sugar assays and MS. We found that GH5_4 enzymes have the highest catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of xyloglucan, glucomannan, and soluble \u03b2-glucans, with opportunistic secondary reactions on cellulose, mannan, and xylan. The positions of key aromatic residues determine the overall reaction rate and breadth of substrate tolerance, and they contribute to differences in oligosaccharide cleavage patterns. Our new composite model identifies several critical structural features that confer broad specificity and may be readily engineered into existing industrial enzymes.

A mechanistic understanding of how these enzymes achieve site-selectivity and directionality has been limited by a lack of structural models. Here, we report the structure of the C-terminal domains of a serine integrase bound to an attP DNA half-site. The structure leads directly to models for understanding how the integrase-bound attP and attB sites differ, why these enzymes preferentially form attP \u00d7 attB synaptic complexes to initiate recombination, and how attL \u00d7 attR recombination is prevented. In these models, different domain organizations on attP vs. attB half-sites allow attachment-site specific interactions to form between integrase subunits via an unusual protruding coiled-coil motif. These interactions are used to preferentially synapse integrase-bound attP and attB and inhibit synapsis of integrase-bound attL and attR.

Analysis of the Tm1743 crystal structure in complex with tolrestat alone and epalrestat-NADP <sup>+ </sup> shows that tolrestat, but not epalrestat, binding triggers dramatic conformational changes in the anionic site and cofactor binding pocket that prevents accommodation of NADP <sup>+ </sup> . Enzymatic and molecular dynamics simulation analyses further confirm tolrestat as a competitive inhibitor of Tm1743."

We have solved the structure of a chimeric mutant c-Src-SH3 domain where specific residues at the RT- and n-Src-loops have been replaced by those present in the corresponding Abl-SH3 domain. Crystals of the chimeric protein show a single molecule in the asymmetric unit, which appears in an unfolded-like structure that upon generation of the symmetry related molecules reveals the presence of a domain swapped dimer where both, RT- and n-Src loops, act as hinge loops. In contrast, the fold of the diverging type II \u03b2-turn and the distal loop are well conserved. Our results are the first evidence for the presence of a structured diverging type II \u03b2-turn in an unfolded-like intermediate of the c-Src-SH3 domain, which can be stabilized by interactions from the \u03b2-strands of the same polypeptide chain or from a neighboring one. Futhermore, this crystallographic structure opens a unique opportunity to study the effect of the amino acid sequence of the hinge loops on the 3D domain swapping process of c-Src-SH3. "

Whereas the disease is treatable, the drug regimen is arduous at best with the use of four antimicrobials over a six-month period. There is clearly a pressing need for the development of new therapeutics. One potential target for structure-based drug design is the enzyme RmlA, a glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferase. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose, which is a deoxysugar critical for the integrity of the bacterium's cell wall. Here, we report the X-ray structures of M. tuberculosis RmlA in complex with either dTTP or dTDP-glucose to 1.6 \u00c5 and 1.85 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. In the RmlA/dTTP complex, two magnesium ions were observed binding to the nucleotide, both ligated in octahedral coordination spheres. In the RmlA/dTDP-glucose complex, only a single magnesium ion was observed. Importantly, for RmlA-type enzymes with known three-dimensional structures, not one model shows the position of the magnesium ion bound to the nucleotide-linked sugar. As such, this investigation represents the first direct observation of the manner in which a magnesium ion is coordinated to the RmlA product and thus has important ramifications for structure-based drug design. In the past, molecular modeling procedures have been employed to derive a three-dimensional model of the M. tuberculosis RmlA for drug design. The X-ray structures presented herein provide a superior molecular scaffold for such endeavors in the treatment of one of the world's deadliest diseases."

Characterised by slow activation/deactivation but rapid inactivation/recovery from inactivation, the unique gating kinetics underlie the central role hERG channels play in cardiac repolarisation. The slow activation and deactivation kinetics are regulated in part by the S4-S5 linker, which couples movement of the voltage sensor domain to opening of the activation gate at the distal end of the inner helix of the pore domain. It has also been suggested that cytosolic domains may interact with the S4-S5 linker to regulate activation and deactivation kinetics. Here, we show that the solution structure of a peptide corresponding to the S4-S5 linker of hERG contains an amphipathic helix. The effects of mutations at the majority of residues in the S4-S5 linker of hERG were consistent with the previously identified role in coupling voltage sensor movement to the activation gate. However, mutations to Ser543, Tyr545, Gly546 and Ala548 had more complex phenotypes indicating that these residues are involved in additional interactions. We propose a model in which the S4-S5 linker, in addition to coupling VSD movement to the activation gate, also contributes to interactions that stabilise the closed state and a separate set of interactions that stabilise the open state. The S4-S5 linker therefore acts as a signal integrator and plays a crucial role in the slow deactivation kinetics of the channel."

GH5 has over 50 subfamilies exhibiting selectivities for reaction with \u03b2-(1,4)-linked oligo- and polysaccharides. Among these, subfamily 4 (GH5_4) contains numerous broad-selectivity endoglucanases that hydrolyze cellulose, xyloglucan, and mixed-linkage glucans. We previously surveyed the whole subfamily and found over 100 new broad-specificity endoglucanases, although the structural origins of broad specificity remained unclear. A mechanistic understanding of GH5_4 substrate specificity would help inform the best protein design strategies and the most appropriate industrial application of broad-specificity endoglucanases. Here we report structures of 10 new GH5_4 enzymes from cellulolytic microbes and characterize their substrate selectivity using normalized reducing sugar assays and MS. We found that GH5_4 enzymes have the highest catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis of xyloglucan, glucomannan, and soluble \u03b2-glucans, with opportunistic secondary reactions on cellulose, mannan, and xylan. The positions of key aromatic residues determine the overall reaction rate and breadth of substrate tolerance, and they contribute to differences in oligosaccharide cleavage patterns. Our new composite model identifies several critical structural features that confer broad specificity and may be readily engineered into existing industrial enzymes. We demonstrate that GH5_4 endoglucanases can have broad specificity without sacrificing high activity, making them a valuable addition to the biomass deconstruction toolset."

The C-terminal catalytic SET (Su(var.)3-9, enhancer of zeste and trithorax) domains of MLL proteins are associated with a common set of regulatory factors (WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L and DPY30) to achieve specific activities <sup>7-9 </sup>. Current knowledge of the regulation of MLL activity is limited to the catalysis of histone H3 peptides, and how H3K4 methyl marks are deposited on nucleosomes is poorly understood. H3K4 methylation is stimulated by mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine\u00a0120 (H2BK120ub1), a prevalent histone H2B mark that disrupts chromatin compaction and favours open chromatin structures, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown <sup>10-12 </sup>. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MLL1 and MLL3 catalytic modules associated with nucleosome core particles that contain H2BK120ub1 or unmodified H2BK120. These structures demonstrate that the MLL1 and MLL3 complexes both make extensive contacts with the histone-fold and DNA regions of the nucleosome; this allows ease of access to the histone H3 tail, which is essential for the efficient methylation of H3K4. The H2B-conjugated ubiquitin binds directly to RBBP5, orienting the association between MLL1 or MLL3 and the nucleosome. The MLL1 and MLL3 complexes display different structural organizations at the interface between the WDR5, RBBP5 and MLL1 (or the corresponding MLL3) subunits, which accounts for the opposite roles of WDR5 in regulating the activity of the two enzymes. These findings transform our understanding of the structural basis for the regulation of MLL activity at the nucleosome level, and highlight the pivotal role of nucleosome regulation in histone-tail modification."

Apo(a) contains 14-37 kringle 4 (KIV) repeats distributed into 10 classes (1-10). Lp(a) binds lysine-Sepharose via a lysine binding site (LBS) located in KIV-10 (88% homology with plasminogen K4). However, the W72R substitution that occurs in rhesus monkeys and occasionally in humans leads to impaired lysine binding capacity of KIV-10 and Lp(a). The foregoing has been investigated by determining the structures of KIV-10/M66 (M66 variant) in its unliganded and ligand [epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA)] bound modes and the structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 (the W72R mutant). In addition, the EACA liganded structure of a sequence polymorph (M66T in about 42-50% of the human population) was reexamined (KIV-10/T66/EACA). The KIV-10/M66, KIV-10/M66/EACA, and KIV-10/T66/EACA molecular structures are highly isostructural, indicating that the LBS of the kringles is preformed anticipating ligand binding. A displacement of three water molecules from the EACA binding groove and a movement of R35 bringing the guanidinium group close to the carboxylate of EACA to assist R71 in stabilizing the anionic group of the ligand are the only changes accompanying ligand binding. Both EACA structures were in the embedded binding mode utilizing all three binding centers (anionic, hydrophobic, cationic) like plasminogen kringles 1 and 4. The KIV-10/T66/EACA structure determined in this work differs from one previously reported [Mikol, V., Lo Grasso, P. V. and, Boettcher, B. R. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 256, 751-761], which crystallized in a different crystal system and displayed an unbound binding mode, where only the amino group of EACA interacted with the anionic center of the LBS. The remainder of the ligand extended into solvent perpendicular to the kringle surface, leaving the hydrophobic pocket and the cationic center of the LBS unoccupied. The structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 shows that R72 extends along the ligand binding groove parallel to the expected position of EACA toward the anionic center (D55/D57) and makes a salt bridge with D57. Thus, the R72 side chain mimics ligand binding, and loss of binding ability is the result of steric blockage of the LBS by R72 physically occupying part of the site. The rhesus monkey lysine binding impairment is compared with that of chimpanzee where KIV-10 has been shown to have a D57N mutation instead."

Evidence is presented that the interaction between the indole group of Trp154 and the carboxylated lysine is essential for the stability of the posttranslationally modified Lys70. Substitution of Trp154 by Gly, Ala, or Phe yielded noncarboxylated enzymes which displayed poor catalytic efficiencies and reduced stability when compared to the wild-type OXA-10. The W154H mutant was partially carboxylated. In addition, the maximum values of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(M) were shifted toward pH 7, indicating that the carboxylation state of Lys70 is dependent on the protonation level of the histidine. A comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the different proteins also indicated that the Trp154 mutations did not modify the overall structures of OXA-10 but induced an increased flexibility of the Omega-loop in the active site. Finally, the deacylation-impaired W154A mutant was used to determine the structure of the acyl-enzyme complex with benzylpenicillin.

However, only a small number of ALDH1A2 inhibitors have been reported, and information on the structure of ALDH1A2 was limited to the NAD-liganded enzyme void of substrate or inhibitors. Herein, we describe the mechanism of action of structurally unrelated reversible and irreversible inhibitors of human ALDH1A2 using direct binding studies and X-ray crystallography. All inhibitors bind to the active sites of tetrameric ALDH1A2. Compound WIN18,446 covalently reacts with the side chain of the catalytic residue Cys320, resulting in a chiral adduct in ( R) configuration. The covalent adduct directly affects the neighboring NAD molecule, which assumes a contracted conformation suboptimal for the dehydrogenase reaction. The reversible inhibitors interact predominantly through direct hydrogen bonding interactions with residues in the vicinity of Cys320 without affecting NAD. Upon interaction with inhibitors, a large flexible loop assumes regular structure, thereby shielding the active site from solvent. The precise knowledge of the binding modes provides a new framework for the rational design of novel inhibitors of ALDH1A2 with improved potency and selectivity profiles."

To achieve this, H. influenzae utilizes a tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter. In this study, we characterize the binding site of the extracytoplasmic solute receptor (SiaP) from nontypeable H. influenzae strain 2019. A crystal structure of N-acetyl-5-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-bound SiaP was determined to 1.4A resolution. Thermodynamic characterization of Neu5Ac binding shows this interaction is enthalpically driven with a substantial unfavorable contribution from entropy. This is expected because the binding of SiaP to Neu5Ac is mediated by numerous hydrogen bonds and has several buried water molecules. Point mutations targeting specific amino acids were introduced in the putative binding site. Complementation with the mutated siaP constructs resulted either in full, partial, or no complementation, depending on the role of specific residues. Mass spectrometry analysis of the O-deacylated LOS of the R127K point mutation confirmed the observation of reduced incorporation of Neu5Ac into the LOS. The decreased ability of H. influenzae to import sialic acid had negative effects on resistance to complement-mediated killing and viability of biofilms in vitro, confirming the importance of sialic acid transport to the bacterium."

However, only a small number of ALDH1A2 inhibitors have been reported, and information on the structure of ALDH1A2 was limited to the NAD-liganded enzyme void of substrate or inhibitors. Herein, we describe the mechanism of action of structurally unrelated reversible and irreversible inhibitors of human ALDH1A2 using direct binding studies and X-ray crystallography. All inhibitors bind to the active sites of tetrameric ALDH1A2. Compound WIN18,446 covalently reacts with the side chain of the catalytic residue Cys320, resulting in a chiral adduct in ( R) configuration. The covalent adduct directly affects the neighboring NAD molecule, which assumes a contracted conformation suboptimal for the dehydrogenase reaction. The reversible inhibitors interact predominantly through direct hydrogen bonding interactions with residues in the vicinity of Cys320 without affecting NAD. Upon interaction with inhibitors, a large flexible loop assumes regular structure, thereby shielding the active site from solvent. The precise knowledge of the binding modes provides a new framework for the rational design of novel inhibitors of ALDH1A2 with improved potency and selectivity profiles."

Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidogenesis requires rate-limiting tetramer dissociation before misassembly of a partially denatured monomer ensues. Selective stabilization of the native TTR tetramer over the dissociative transition state by small molecule binding to both thyroxine binding sites raises the kinetic barrier of tetramer dissociation, preventing amyloidogenesis. Assessing the amyloidogenicity of a TTR tetramer having only one amyloidogenesis inhibitor (I) bound is challenging because the two small molecule binding constants are generally not distinct enough to allow for the exclusive formation of TTR.I in solution to the exclusion of TTR.I(2) and unliganded TTR. Herein, we report a method to tether one fibril formation inhibitor to TTR by disulfide bond formation. Occupancy of only one of the two thyroxine binding sites is sufficient to inhibit tetramer dissociation in 6.0 M urea and amyloidogenesis under acidic conditions by imposing kinetic stabilization on the entire tetramer. The sufficiency of single occupancy for stabilizing the native state of TTR provides the incentive to search for compounds displaying striking negative binding cooperativity (e.g., K(d1) in nanomolar range and K(d2) in the micromolar to millimolar range), enabling lower doses of inhibitor to be employed in the clinic, mitigating potential side effects."

Increased intracellular polyamine levels accompany several types of cancers as well as other human diseases, and compounds that affect the expression, activity, or stability of SSAT are being explored as potential therapeutic drugs. We have expressed human SSAT from the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli and have determined high-resolution structures of wild-type and mutant SSAT, as the free dimer and in binary and ternary complexes with CoA, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), spermine, and the inhibitor N1,N11bis-(ethyl)-norspermine (BE-3-3-3). These structures show details of binding sites for cofactor, substrates, and inhibitor and provide a framework to understand enzymatic activity, mutations, and the action of potential drugs. Two dimer conformations were observed: a symmetric form with two open surface channels capable of binding substrate or cofactor, and an asymmetric form in which only one of the surface channels appears capable of binding and acetylating polyamines. SSAT was found to self-acetylate lysine-26 in the presence of AcCoA and absence of substrate, a reaction apparently catalzyed by AcCoA bound in the second channel of the asymmetric dimer. These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating SSAT activity or stability as a part of polyamine homeostasis.

We report here on its structure in solution as determined by high-resolution NMR analysis, together with investigations of its conformation and packing at the air-water interface using a combination of infrared and neutron reflectivity techniques.

The NMR structure of Rsn-2 shows no obvious amphiphilicity that might be anticipated for a surfactant protein. This suggests that it must undergo a significant conformational change when incorporated into the air-water interface that may involve a hinge-bending, clamshell opening of the separate helix and sheet segments to expose hydrophobic faces to air while maintaining the highly polar surfaces in contact with the underlying water layer. This model is supported by direct observation of the relative orientations of secondary structure elements at the interface by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, and by protein packing densities determined from neutron reflectivity profiles."

To learn more about SpnP, the structures of SpnP and its complex with TDP were determined to 2.50 and 3.15 \u00c5 resolution, respectively.

Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme for NAD <sup>+ </sup> salvage from nicotinamide, has been investigated as a target for anticancer therapy. Known NAMPT inhibitors with potent cell activity are composed of a nitrogen-containing aromatic group, which is phosphoribosylated by the enzyme. Here, we identified two novel types of NAM-competitive NAMPT inhibitors, only one of which contains a modifiable, aromatic nitrogen that could be a phosphoribosyl acceptor. Both types of compound effectively deplete cellular NAD <sup>+ </sup>, and subsequently ATP, and produce cell death when NAMPT is inhibited in cultured cells for more than 48 hours. Careful characterization of the kinetics of NAMPT inhibition  <i>in vivo </i> allowed us to optimize dosing to produce sufficient NAD <sup>+ </sup> depletion over time that resulted in efficacy in an HCT116 xenograft model.

We have previously reported the crystallization of Korean pine vicilin purified from raw pine nut. Here we report the isolation of vicilin mRNA and the crystal structure of Korean pine vicilin at 2.40 \u00c5 resolution. The overall structure of pine nut vicilin is similar to the structures of other 7S seed storage proteins and consists of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. Each assumes a cupin fold, and they are symmetrically related about a pseudodyad axis. Three vicilin molecules form a doughnut-shaped trimer through head-to-tail association. Structure characterization of Korean pine nut vicilin unexpectedly showed that, in its native trimeric state, the vicilin has three copper ligands. Sequence alignments suggested that the copper-coordinating residues were conserved in winter squash, sesame, tomato, and several tree nuts, while they were not conserved in a number of legumes, including peanut and soybean. Additional studies are needed to assess whether the copper-coordinating property of vicilins has a biological function in the relevant plants. The nutritional value of this copper-coordinating protein in tree nuts and other edible seeds may be worth further investigations. "

Here we present a method that incorporates solid-state NMR restraints alongside of X-ray reflections to the conventional model building and refinement steps of structure calculations. Using the 3.7 \u00c5 crystal structure of the integral membrane protein complex DsbB-DsbA as a test case yielded a significantly improved backbone precision of 0.92 \u00c5 in the transmembrane region, a 58% enhancement from using X-ray reflections alone. Furthermore, addition of solid-state NMR restraints greatly improved the overall quality of the structure by promoting 22% of DsbB transmembrane residues into the most favored regions of Ramachandran space in comparison to the crystal structure. This method is widely applicable to any protein system where X-ray data are available, and is particularly useful for the study of weakly diffracting crystals."

The redox reaction is catalyzed at the interface between two components (dI and dIII) which protrude from the membrane. A complex formed from recombinant dI and dIII (the dI(2)dIII(1) complex) from Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase catalyzes fast single-turnover hydride transfer between bound nucleotides. In this report we describe three new crystal structures of the dI(2)dIII(1) complex in different nucleotide-bound forms. The structures reveal an asymmetry in nucleotide binding that complements results from solution studies and supports the notion that intact transhydrogenase functions by an alternating site mechanism. In one structure, the redox site is occupied by NADH (on dI) and NADPH (on dIII). The dihydronicotinamide rings take up positions which may approximate to the ground state for hydride transfer: the redox-active C4(N) atoms are separated by only 3.6 A, and the perceived reaction stereochemistry matches that observed experimentally. The NADH conformation is different in the two dI polypeptides of this form of the dI(2)dIII(1) complex. Comparisons between a number of X-ray structures show that a conformational change in the NADH is driven by relative movement of the two domains which comprise dI. It is suggested that an equivalent conformational change in the intact enzyme is important in gating the hydride-transfer reaction. The observed nucleotide conformational change in the dI(2)dIII(1) complex is accompanied by rearrangements in the orientation of local amino acid side chains which may be responsible for sealing the site from the solvent and polarizing hydride transfer."

NS1 antagonizes host defense mechanisms through interactions with multiple host factors. One pathway by which NS1 increases virulence is through the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) by binding to its p85\u03b2 subunit. Here we present the mechanism underlying the molecular recognition of the p85\u03b2 subunit by 1918 NS1. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine the structure of 1918 NS1 complexed with p85\u03b2 of human PI3K. We find that the 1918 NS1 effector domain (1918 NS1 <sup>ED </sup>) undergoes a conformational change to bind p85\u03b2. Using NMR relaxation dispersion and molecular dynamics simulation, we identify that free 1918 NS1 <sup>ED </sup> exists in a dynamic equilibrium between p85\u03b2-binding-competent and -incompetent conformations in the submillisecond timescale. Moreover, we discover that NS1 <sup>ED </sup> proteins of 1918 (H1N1) and Udorn (H3N2) strains exhibit drastically different conformational dynamics and binding kinetics to p85\u03b2. These results provide evidence of strain-dependent conformational dynamics of NS1. Using kinetic modeling based on the experimental data, we demonstrate that 1918 NS1 <sup>ED </sup> can result in the faster hijacking of p85\u03b2 compared to Ud NS1 <sup>ED </sup>, although the former has a lower affinity to p85\u03b2 than the latter. Our results suggest that the difference in binding kinetics may impact the competition with cellular antiviral responses for the activation of PI3K.

The analysis of unligated and AMP-bound subunits of M.voltae suggests that movements of two mobile domains are not independent of each other. The methanococcal structures are examined with respect to their lack of the \"invariant\" Lys residue within the phosphate-binding loop, and two Arg residues in the LID domain are proposed as substituting residues based on their conservation among archaeal adenylate kinases and mobility within the structures. Since S.acidocaldarius adenylate kinase has the invariant Lys residue as well as the two Arg residues, its phosphate-binding loop is examined and compared with those of other adenylate kinases. On the basis of the comparison and other available biochemical data, the unusual conformation of the Lys residue in S.acidocaldarius adenylate kinase is explained. Despite possessing 78% sequence identity, the methanococcal enzymes exhibit significantly different thermal stabilities. To study the determinants of thermostability, several structural features including salt-links, hydrogen bonds, packing density, surface to volume ratio and buried surface area are compared between the enzymes. From their difference in apolar buried surface area, hydrophobic interaction is proposed to be a basis for the disparate thermostabilities, and the corresponding free energy difference is also estimated. Results of previous mutational studies are interpreted in terms of the crystal structures, and support the importance of hydrophobic interactions in thermostability."

In the present study, we present a surprise observation of maltotetraose at the active site, the presence of which elucidates the clear role of Thr344 as a conformational \"switch\" between substrate binding and product release during hydrolysis. This observation is confirmed by the selection of maltotetraose by the crystallized enzyme although that carbohydrate was present in only trace amounts. The conformation of the residues in the substrate-binding site changed upon substrate binding, leading to the movement of threonine, glutamic acid, and the loop conformation, elucidating a missing link in the existing mechanism. By aligning our substrate-free and maltotetraose-bound structures with other existing structures, the sequence of events from substrate binding to hydrolysis can be visualized. Apart from this, the evolutionary relationship among \u03b2-amylases of bacterial and amyloplastic origin could be established. The presence of a sugar-binding domain in the bacterial enzyme and its absence in the plant counterpart could be attributed to a carbohydrate-rich environment.

One group of secreted toxins with key roles during infection is the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs). PSMs are amphipathic, membrane-destructive cytolytic peptides that are exported to the host-cell environment by a designated adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, the PSM transporter (PmtABCD). Here, we demonstrate that the minimal Pmt unit necessary for PSM export is PmtCD and provide its first atomic characterization by single-particle cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography. We have captured the transporter in the ATP-bound state at near atomic resolution, revealing a type II ABC exporter fold, with an additional cytosolic domain. Comparison to a lower-resolution nucleotide-free map displaying an \"open\" conformation and putative hydrophobic inner chamber of a size able to accommodate the binding of two PSM peptides provides mechanistic insight and sets the foundation for therapeutic design."

The crystal structure of yeast PDI reveals that the four thioredoxin domains are arranged in the shape of a twisted \"U\" with the active sites facing each other across the long sides of the \"U.\" The inside surface of the \"U\" is enriched in hydrophobic residues, thereby facilitating interactions with misfolded proteins. The domain arrangement, active site location, and surface features strikingly resemble the Escherichia coli DsbC and DsbG protein disulfide isomerases. Biochemical studies demonstrate that all domains of PDI, including the C-terminal tail, are required for full catalytic activity.

The first loop on GSDMD-C inserts into the N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N), which helps stabilize the conformation of the full-length GSDMD.

The small-angle X-ray-scattering envelope of human GSDMD is consistent with the modeled GSDMD structure and mouse GSDMA3 structure, which suggests that GSDMD adopts an autoinhibited conformation in solution. The positive potential surface of GSDMD-N covered by GSDMD-C is exposed after being released from the autoinhibition state and can form high-order oligomers via a charge-charge interaction. Furthermore, by mapping different regions of GSDMD, we determined that one short segment is sufficient to kill bacteria in vitro and can efficiently inhibit cell growth in  <i>Escherichia coli </i> and  <i>Mycobacterium Smegmatis </i> These findings reveal that GSDMD-C acts as an auto-inhibition executor and GSDMD-N could form pore structures via a charge-charge interaction upon cleavage by caspases during cell pyroptosis."

Remarkably, splice variants that differ only by the insertion of a single glycine residue in the beta1/beta2 loop exhibit dual specificity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and PtdIns(4,5)P(2). The structural basis for this dramatic specificity switch is not apparent from the known modes of phosphoinositide recognition.

Loss of contacts with the beta1/beta2 loop with no significant change in head group orientation accounts for the significant decrease in PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) affinity observed for the dual specificity variants. Conversely, a small increase rather than decrease in affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P(2) is explained by a novel binding mode, in which the glycine insertion alleviates unfavorable interactions with the beta1/beta2 loop.

In the present study, we present a surprise observation of maltotetraose at the active site, the presence of which elucidates the clear role of Thr344 as a conformational \"switch\" between substrate binding and product release during hydrolysis. This observation is confirmed by the selection of maltotetraose by the crystallized enzyme although that carbohydrate was present in only trace amounts. The conformation of the residues in the substrate-binding site changed upon substrate binding, leading to the movement of threonine, glutamic acid, and the loop conformation, elucidating a missing link in the existing mechanism. By aligning our substrate-free and maltotetraose-bound structures with other existing structures, the sequence of events from substrate binding to hydrolysis can be visualized. Apart from this, the evolutionary relationship among \u03b2-amylases of bacterial and amyloplastic origin could be established. The presence of a sugar-binding domain in the bacterial enzyme and its absence in the plant counterpart could be attributed to a carbohydrate-rich environment. Interestingly, cladogram analysis indicates the presence of N-terminal additions in some plant \u03b2-amylases.

Passive transfer of one of these antibodies, monoclonal antibody CIS43, conferred high-level, sterile protection in two different mouse models of malaria infection. The affinity and stoichiometry of CIS43 binding to PfCSP indicate that there are two sequential multivalent binding events encompassing the repeat domain. The first binding event is to a unique 'junctional' epitope positioned between the N terminus and the central repeat domain of PfCSP. Moreover, CIS43 prevented proteolytic cleavage of PfCSP on PfSPZ. Analysis of crystal structures of the CIS43 antigen-binding fragment in complex with the junctional epitope determined the molecular interactions of binding, revealed the epitope's conformational flexibility and defined Asn-Pro-Asn (NPN) as the structural repeat motif.

Binding of Cu(I) to apo-CopK induces a conformational change that releases the C-terminal \u03b2-strand from the \u03b2-sandwich structure. In turn, this allows His70 and N-terminal residues to form a large loop that includes the Cu(II) binding site. In crystals, a polymeric form of Cu(I)Cu(II)-CopK displays a Cu(I) site defined by the S(\u03b4) atoms of Met26, -38, and -54 (site 3S) and an exogenous ligand (modeled as H(2)O) and a Cu(II) site that bridges dimeric CopK molecules.

Beyond a similar 180\u00b0 rotation of the L-nucleotide ribose ring seen in other studies, the pre-catalytic ternary crystal structures of hPol\u03b2, DNA and L-dCTP or the triphosphate forms of antiviral drugs lamivudine ((-)3TC-TP) and emtricitabine ((-)FTC-TP) provide little structural evidence to suggest that hPol\u03b2 follows the previously characterized mechanisms of D-stereoselectivity. Instead, hPol\u03b2 discriminates against L-stereochemistry through accumulation of several active site rearrangements that lead to a decreased nucleotide binding affinity and incorporation rate. The two NRTIs escape some of the active site selection through the base and sugar modifications but are selected against through the inability of hPol\u03b2 to complete thumb domain closure."

HER3 amplifies phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-driven tumorigenesis and its upregulation in response to other anti-HER therapies has been implicated in resistance to them. Here, we report the development and characterization of RG7116, a novel anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed to block HER3 activation, downregulate HER3, and mediate enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via glycoengineering of the Fc moiety. Biochemical studies and X-ray crystallography revealed that RG7116 bound potently and selectively to domain 1 of human HER3. Heregulin binding was prevented by RG7116 at concentrations more than 1 nmol/L as was nearly complete inhibition of HER3 heterodimerization and phosphorylation, thereby preventing downstream AKT phosphorylation. In vivo RG7116 treatment inhibited xenograft tumor growth up to 90% relative to controls in a manner accompanied by downregulation of cell surface HER3. RG7116 efficacy was further enhanced in combination with anti-EGFR (RG7160) or anti-HER2 (pertuzumab) mAbs. Furthermore, the ADCC potency of RG7116 was enhanced compared with the nonglycoengineered parental antibody, both in vitro and in orthotopic tumor xenograft models, where an increased median survival was documented. ADCC degree achieved in vitro correlated with HER3 expression levels on tumor cells. In summary, the combination of strong signaling inhibition and enhanced ADCC capability rendered RG7116 a highly potent HER3-targeting agent suitable for clinical development."

In Escherichia coli, PriA, PriB, and DnaT assemble in an orderly fashion at the stalled replication fork and achieve the reloading of the replisome. PriB-DnaT interaction is considered a significant step in the replication restart. In this study, we examined the contribution of the residues Ser20, His26 and Ser55, which are located on the PriB dimer interface. These residues are proximal to Glu39 and Arg44, which are important for PriB-DnaT interaction. Mutational analyses revealed that His26 and Ser20 of PriB are important for the interaction with DnaT, and that the Ser55 residue of PriB might have a role in negatively regulating the DnaT binding. These residues are involved in not only the interaction between PriB and DnaT but also the dissociation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from the PriB-ssDNA complex due to DnaT binding. Moreover, NMR study indicates that the region Asp66-Glu76 on the linker between DnaT domains is involved in the interaction with wild-type PriB. These findings provide significant information about the molecular mechanism underlying replication restart in bacteria."

To understand the role of this interaction, we studied the K48Q mutant of Escherichia coli TS using structural and biophysical methods. The k(cat) of the K48Q mutant was 430-fold lower than wild-type TS in activity, while the K(m) for the (R)-stereoisomer of CH(2)THF was 300 microM, about 30-fold larger than K(m) from the wild-type TS. Affinity constants were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry, which showed that binding was reduced by one order of magnitude for folate-like TS inhibitors, such as propargyl-dideazafolate (PDDF) or compounds that distort the TS active site like BW1843U89 (U89). The crystal structure of the K48Q-dUMP complex revealed that dUMP binding is not impaired in the mutant, and that U89 in a ternary complex of K48Q-nucleotide-U89 was bound in the active site with subtle differences relative to comparable wild-type complexes. PDDF failed to form ternary complexes with K48Q and dUMP. Thermodynamic data correlated with the structural determinations, since PDDF binding was dominated by enthalpic effects while U89 had an important entropic component. In conclusion, K48 is critical for catalysis since it leads to a productive CH(2)THF binding, while mutation at this residue does not affect much the binding of inhibitors that do not make contact with this group."

The redox reaction is catalyzed at the interface between two components (dI and dIII) which protrude from the membrane. A complex formed from recombinant dI and dIII (the dI(2)dIII(1) complex) from Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase catalyzes fast single-turnover hydride transfer between bound nucleotides. In this report we describe three new crystal structures of the dI(2)dIII(1) complex in different nucleotide-bound forms. The structures reveal an asymmetry in nucleotide binding that complements results from solution studies and supports the notion that intact transhydrogenase functions by an alternating site mechanism. In one structure, the redox site is occupied by NADH (on dI) and NADPH (on dIII). The dihydronicotinamide rings take up positions which may approximate to the ground state for hydride transfer: the redox-active C4(N) atoms are separated by only 3.6 A, and the perceived reaction stereochemistry matches that observed experimentally. The NADH conformation is different in the two dI polypeptides of this form of the dI(2)dIII(1) complex. Comparisons between a number of X-ray structures show that a conformational change in the NADH is driven by relative movement of the two domains which comprise dI. It is suggested that an equivalent conformational change in the intact enzyme is important in gating the hydride-transfer reaction. The observed nucleotide conformational change in the dI(2)dIII(1) complex is accompanied by rearrangements in the orientation of local amino acid side chains which may be responsible for sealing the site from the solvent and polarizing hydride transfer."

Among the reported BRD4 inhibitors are dihydropteridinones and benzopyrimidodiazepinones originally designed to target the kinases PLK1, ERK5, and LRRK2. While these kinase inhibitors were identified as BRD4 inhibitors, little is known about their binding potential and structural details of interaction with the other BET bromodomains. We comprehensively characterized a series of known and newly identified dual BRD4-kinase inhibitors against all eight individual BET bromodomains. A detailed analysis of 23 novel cocrystal structures of BET-kinase inhibitor complexes in combination with direct binding assays and cell signaling studies revealed significant differences in molecular shape complementarity and inhibitory potential. Collectively, the data offer new insights into the action of kinase inhibitors across BET bromodomains, which may aid the development of drugs to inhibit certain BET proteins and kinases differentially."

In the present study, we determined the solution structures of two hU2AF(65) fragments, corresponding to the first and second RNA-binding domains (RBD1 and RBD2, respectively), by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The tertiary structure of RBD2 is similar to that of typical RNA-binding domains with the beta1-alpha1-beta2-beta3-alpha2-beta4 topology. In contrast, the hU2AF(65) RBD1 structure has unique features: (i) the alpha1 helix is elongated by one turn toward the C-terminus; (ii) the loop between alpha1 and beta2 (the alpha1/beta2 loop) is much longer and has a defined conformation; (iii) the beta2 strand is (188)AVQIN(192), which was not predicted by sequence alignments; and (iv) the beta2/beta3 loop is much shorter. Chemical shift perturbation experiments showed that the U2AF-binding RNA fragments interact with the four beta-strands of RBD2 whereas, in contrast, they interact with beta1, beta3 and beta4, but not with beta2 or the alpha1/beta2 loop, of RBD1. The characteristic alpha1-beta2 structure of the hU2AF(65) RBD1 may interact with other proteins, such as UAP56."

LptC is an essential inner membrane-anchored protein with a large periplasm-protruding domain. LptC binds the inner membrane LptBFG ABC transporter and interacts with the periplasmic protein LptA. However, its role in lipopolysaccharide transport is unclear. Here we show that LptC lacking the transmembrane region is viable and can bind the LptBFG inner membrane complex; thus, the essential LptC functions are located in the periplasmic domain. In addition, we characterize two previously described inactive single mutations at two conserved glycines (G56V and G153R, respectively) of the LptC periplasmic domain, showing that neither mutant is able to assemble the transenvelope machinery. However, while LptCG56V failed to copurify any Lpt component, LptCG153R was able to interact with the inner membrane protein complex LptBFG. Overall, our data further support the model whereby the bridge connecting the inner and outer membranes would be based on the conserved structurally homologous jellyroll domain shared by five out of the seven Lpt components."

Although antifungal azoles show promise, direct screening of compounds against M. tuberculosis P450 enzymes may identify novel, more potent, and selective inhibitory scaffolds. Here we report that CYP130 from M. tuberculosis has a natural propensity to bind primary arylamines with particular chemical architectures. These compounds were identified via a high throughput screen of CYP130 with a library of synthetic organic molecules. As revealed by subsequent x-ray structure analysis, selected compounds bind in the active site by Fe-coordination and hydrogen bonding of the arylamine group to the carbonyl oxygen of Gly(243). As evidenced by the binding of structural analogs, the primary arylamine group is indispensable, but synergism due to hydrophobic contacts between the rest of the molecule and protein amino acid residues is responsible for a binding affinity comparable with that of the antifungal azole drugs. The topology of the CYP130 active site favors angular coordination of the arylamine group over the orthogonal coordination of azoles. Upon substitution of Gly(243) by an alanine, the binding mode of azoles and some arylamines reverted from type II to type I because of hydrophobic and steric interactions with the alanine side chain. We suggest a role for the conserved Ala(Gly)(243)-Gly(244) motif in the I-helix in modulating both the binding affinity of the axial water ligand and the ligand selectivity of cytochrome P450 enzymes."

It has been postulated that the amino-terminal domain, which contains residue 112, influences the lipoprotein preference by interacting with the carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains the lipid-binding region. To delineate the region in the carboxyl-terminal domain mediating lipoprotein binding and involved in isoform preference, we produced truncated apoE3 and apoE4 variants (terminating at residues 251, 260, 266, or 272) in Escherichia coli and assessed them for lipoprotein association. This analysis suggested that residues 260-272 contain important determinants for complete lipoprotein association and isoform preferences. To determine whether positive charge at residue 112 was an absolute requirement for the apoE4 VLDL preference, we compared the distributions of rabbit apoE (equivalent to apoE3, with cysteine at a position corresponding to 112), canine apoE (arginine at the corresponding site), and cysteamine-treated rabbit apoE (cysteine converted to a positively charged residue). Surprisingly, all distributed like human apoE3, suggesting that positive charge at a position corresponding to 112 was not directly responsible for the isoform preference and that other residues in the amino-terminal domain were involved. To determine which residues were involved, the structure of the apoE4 22-kDa fragment (the amino-terminal two-thirds of the molecule) was determined to 2.5 A by x-ray crystallography. Compared with the known four-helix bundle structure of apoE3, the only significant differences in the apoE4 structure were that glutamic acid 109 formed a salt bridge with arginine 112 and that the arginine 61 side chain was displaced to a new position. Site-directed mutagenesis of glutamic acid 109 in apoE3 and arginine 61 in apoE4 demonstrated that the position of the arginine 61 side chain in apoE4 was critical in determining apoE4 lipoprotein distribution, suggesting that arginine 61 interacted with the carboxyl-terminal domain to direct binding to VLDL."

We observe a fixed pattern of gRNA organization among all viral particles, with the major and minor grooves of RNA helices clearly visible. A single layer of RNA directly contacts every copy of the coat protein, with one-third of the interactions occurring at operator-like RNA hairpins.

Although these assays can report on the ability of a rhomboid to catalyze peptide bond cleavage, differences in measured hydrolysis rates can reflect changes in the structure and activity of catalytic residues, as well as the ability of the substrate to access the active site. Here we show that a highly reactive and sterically unencumbered fluorophosphonate activity-based protein profiling probe can be used to report on the catalytic integrity of active site residues in the Escherichia coli GlpG protein. We used results obtained with this probe on GlpG in proteomic samples, in combination with a conventional assay of proteolytic function on purified samples, to identify residues that are located on the cytoplasmic side of the lipid bilayer that are required for maximal proteolytic activity. Regions tested include the 90-residue aqueous-exposed N-terminus that encompasses a globular structure that we have determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance, along with residues on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane domain core. While in most cases mutation or elimination of these residues did not significantly alter the catalytic status of the GlpG active site, the lipid-facing residue Arg227 was found to be important for maintaining a catalytically competent active site. In addition, we found a functionally critical region outside the transmembrane domain (TMD) core that is required for maximal protease activity. This region encompasses an additional 8-10 residues on the N-terminal side of the TMD core that precedes the first transmembrane segment and was not previously known to play a role in rhomboid function. These findings highlight the utility of the activity-based protein profiling approach for the characterization of rhomboid function."

A complex formed from recombinant dI and dIII (the dI(2)dIII(1) complex) from Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase catalyzes fast single-turnover hydride transfer between bound nucleotides. In this report we describe three new crystal structures of the dI(2)dIII(1) complex in different nucleotide-bound forms. The structures reveal an asymmetry in nucleotide binding that complements results from solution studies and supports the notion that intact transhydrogenase functions by an alternating site mechanism. In one structure, the redox site is occupied by NADH (on dI) and NADPH (on dIII). The dihydronicotinamide rings take up positions which may approximate to the ground state for hydride transfer: the redox-active C4(N) atoms are separated by only 3.6 A, and the perceived reaction stereochemistry matches that observed experimentally. The NADH conformation is different in the two dI polypeptides of this form of the dI(2)dIII(1) complex. Comparisons between a number of X-ray structures show that a conformational change in the NADH is driven by relative movement of the two domains which comprise dI. It is suggested that an equivalent conformational change in the intact enzyme is important in gating the hydride-transfer reaction. The observed nucleotide conformational change in the dI(2)dIII(1) complex is accompanied by rearrangements in the orientation of local amino acid side chains which may be responsible for sealing the site from the solvent and polarizing hydride transfer."

Cholesterol plays a critical role in the persistence of M. tuberculosis within the macrophage during latent infection. Catabolism of cholesterol contributes to the pool of propionyl-CoA, a precursor that is incorporated into cell-wall lipids. Arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) is encoded within a gene cluster that is involved in the cholesterol sterol-ring degradation and is essential for intracellular survival. The ability of the NAT from M. tuberculosis (TBNAT) to utilise propionyl-CoA links it to the cholesterol-catabolism pathway. Deleting the nat gene or inhibiting the NAT enzyme prevents intracellular survival and results in depletion of cell-wall lipids. TBNAT has been investigated as a potential target for TB therapies. From a previous high-throughput screen, 3-benzoyl-4-phenyl-1-methylpiperidinol was identified as a selective inhibitor of prokaryotic NAT that exhibited antimycobacterial activity. The compound resulted in time-dependent irreversible inhibition of the NAT activity when tested against NAT from M. marinum (MMNAT). To further evaluate the antimycobacterial activity and the NAT inhibition of this compound, four piperidinol analogues were tested. All five compounds exert potent antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis with MIC values of 2.3-16.9 \u00b5M. Treatment of the MMNAT enzyme with this set of inhibitors resulted in an irreversible time-dependent inhibition of NAT activity. Here we investigate the mechanism of NAT inhibition by studying protein-ligand interactions using mass spectrometry in combination with enzyme analysis and structure determination. We propose a covalent mechanism of NAT inhibition that involves the formation of a reactive intermediate and selective cysteine residue modification. These piperidinols present a unique class of antimycobacterial compounds that have a novel mode of action different from known anti-tubercular drugs."

In this study, we investigated the interaction of these peptides with lipid membranes in an effort to propose a mechanism of interaction. The solution structure of PV5 was determined by proton NMR in the absence and presence of dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Like polyphemusin I, PV5 is a beta-hairpin but appeared less amphipathic in solution. Upon association with DPC micelles, PV5 underwent side chain rearrangements which resulted in an increased amphipathic conformation. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, both peptides were found to have limited affinity for neutral vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC). Incorporation of 25 mol % cholesterol or phosphatidylethanolamine into PC vesicles produced little change in the partitioning of either peptide. Incorporation of 25 mol % phosphatidylglycerol (PG) into PC vesicles, a simple prokaryotic model, resulted in a large increase in the affinity for both peptides, but the partition coefficient for PV5 was almost twice that of polyphemusin I. Differential scanning calorimetry studies supported the partitioning data and demonstrated that neither peptide interacted readily with neutral PC vesicles. Both peptides showed affinity for negatively charged membranes incorporating PG. The affinity of PV5 was much greater as the pretransition peak was absent at low peptide to lipid ratios (1:400) and the reduction in enthalpy of the main transition was greater than that produced by polyphemusin I. Both peptides decreased the lamellar to inverted hexagonal phase transition temperature of PE indicating the induction of negative curvature strain. These results, combined with previous findings that polyphemusin I promotes lipid flip-flop but does not induce significant vesicle leakage, ruled out the torroidal pore and carpet mechanisms of antimicrobial action for these polyphemusins."

The H8P and H8S mutants were almost as stable as the wild-type protein and were poorly fibrillogenic. In contrast, the P7S mutation decreased the thermodynamic stability of 6aJL2 and greatly enhanced its capacity to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The crystal structure of the P7S mutant showed that the substitution induced both local and long-distance effects, such as the rearrangement of the V(L) (variable region of the light chain)-V(L) interface. This mutant crystallized in two orthorhombic polymorphs, P2(1)2(1)2(1) and C222(1). In the latter, a monomer that was not arranged in the typical Bence-Jones dimer was observed for the first time.

The structure comprises an N-terminal IgC2 domain and a C-terminal IgI domain, which are connected by a 5-residue flexible linker. This unique C2-I domain organization is distinct from those of other IgSF members. Four homophilic dimers exist in the crystal and adopt C2-C2 and C2-I dimerization rather than V-V dimerization commonly found in other IgSF members. This type of homophilic association thus presents a novel model for homophilic interaction between C2 domains of IgSF members. Moreover, the crystal structure of HAb18G/CD147 provides a good structural explanation for the established multifunction of CD147 mediated by homo/hetero-oligomerizations and should represent a general architecture of other CD147 family members."

Thus far, extensive studies of recombinant AMPA receptor-auxiliary subunit complexes using engineered protein constructs have not been able to faithfully elucidate the molecular architecture of hippocampal AMPA receptor complexes.

We propose that N@d layers maintain the coiled coils of TAAs in a soluble, export-competent state during autotransport through the outer membrane.

In the complex structure, the NPTY motif forms a type-I beta-turn, and the residues immediately N-terminal to the NPTY motif form an antiparallel beta-sheet with the beta5 strand of the PID domain, the binding mode typically observed in the PID/PTB.peptide complex.

To understand the molecular changes occurring upon binding of the TNP-nucleotide to an ABC-ATPase, we have determined the crystal structure of the TNP-ADP/HlyB-NBD complex at 1.6A resolution. Despite the higher affinity of TNP-ADP, no direct fluorophore-protein interactions were observed. Unexpectedly, only water-mediated interactions were detected between the TNP moiety and Tyr(477), that is engaged in pi-pi stacking with the adenine ring, as well as with two serine residues (Ser(504) and Ser(509)) of the Walker A motif. Interestingly, the side chains of these two serine residues adopt novel conformations that are not observed in the corresponding ADP structure. However, in the crystal structure of the S504A mutant, which binds TNP-ADP with similar affinity to the wild type enzyme, a novel TNP-water interaction compensates for the missing serine side chain. Since this water molecule is not present in the wild type enzyme, these results suggest that only water-mediated interactions provide a structural explanation for the increased affinity of TNP-nucleotides towards ABC-ATPases.

However,\u00a0mutation of this gene in\u00a0Streptomyces sviceus\u00a0did not lead to auxothrophy, as expected from the biosynthetic role of trpF-1 Biochemical characterization of a dozen co-occurring TrpF-2 or TrpF-3, with PriA homologues, explained the prototrophic phenotype, and unveiled an enzyme activity trade-off between TrpF and PriA. X-ray structural analysis suggests that the function of these PriA homologues is mediated by non-conserved mutations in the flexible L5 loop, which may be responsible for different substrate affinities. Thus, the PriA homologues that co-occur with TrpF-3 represent a novel enzyme family, termed PriB, which evolved in response to PRA isomerase activity. The characterization of co-occurring enzymes provides insights into the influence of functional redundancy on the evolution of enzyme function, which could be useful for enzyme functional annotation."

The molecules exhibit different specificities towards target proteinases, where SGCI is a good chymotrypsin inhibitor, its mutant is a potent trypsin inhibitor, and SGTI inhibits both proteinases weakly. Interestingly, SGTI is a much better inhibitor of insect proteinases than of the mammalian ones used in common assays. All three molecules have a similar fold composed from three antiparallel beta-pleated sheets with three disulfide bridges. The proteinase binding loop has a somewhat distinct geometry in all three peptides. Moreover, the stabilization of the structure is different in SGCI and SGTI. Proton-deuterium exchange experiments are indicative of a highly rigid core in SGTI but not in SGCI. We suggest that the observed structural properties play a significant role in the specificity of these inhibitors."

The coiled coils of trimeric autotransporter adhesins (TAAs) are conspicuous for their large number of polar residues in position d of the core, which often leads to their prediction as natively unstructured regions. The most frequent residue, asparagine (N@d), can occur in runs of up to 19 consecutive heptads, frequently in the motif [I/V]xxNTxx. In the Salmonella TAA, SadA, the core asparagines form rings of interacting residues with the following threonines, grouped around a central anion. This conformation is observed generally in N@d layers from trimeric coiled coils of known structure. Attempts to impose a different register on the motif show that the asparagines orient themselves specifically into the core, even against conflicting information from flanking domains. When engineered into the GCN4 leucine zipper, N@d layers progressively destabilized the structure, but zippers with 3 N@d layers still folded at high concentration. We propose that N@d layers maintain the coiled coils of TAAs in a soluble, export-competent state during autotransport through the outer membrane. More generally, we think that polar motifs that are both periodic and conserved may often reflect special folding requirements, rather than an unstructured state of the mature proteins."

A proteolytic cleavage of a protein can generate Arg at the N terminus of a resulting C-terminal (Ct) fragment either directly or after Nt-arginylation of that Ct-fragment by the Ate1 arginyl-tRNA-protein transferase (R-transferase), which uses Arg-tRNA <sup>Arg </sup> as a cosubstrate.

A detailed mechanism of arginylation is unknown as well. We describe here the crystal structure of the Ate1 R-transferase from the budding yeast  <i>Kluyveromyces lactis </i>. The 58-kDa R-transferase comprises two domains that recognize, together, an acidic Nt-residue of an acceptor substrate, the Arg residue of Arg-tRNA <sup>Arg </sup>, and a 3'-proximal segment of the tRNA <sup>Arg </sup> moiety. The enzyme's active site is located, at least in part, between the two domains.

At present, there is no uniformly effective treatment for any of these infections. However, sterol 14\u03b1-demethylases (CYP51s), heme-containing cytochrome P450 enzymes, are known to be validated drug targets in pathogenic fungi and protozoa. The catalytically active P450 form of CYP51 from  <i>A. castellanii </i> (AcCYP51) is stabilized against conversion to the inactive P420 form by dimerization. In contrast,  <i>Naegleria fowleri </i> CYP51 (NfCYP51) is monomeric in its active P450 and inactive P420 forms. For these two CYP51 enzymes, we have investigated the interplay between the enzyme activity and oligomerization state using steady-state and time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. In both enzymes, the P450 \u2192 P420 transition is favored under reducing conditions. The transition is accelerated at higher pH, which excludes a protonated thiol as the proximal ligand in P420. Displacement of the proximal thiolate ligand is also promoted by adding exogenous nitrogenous ligands (N-ligands) such as imidazole, isavuconazole, and clotrimazole that bind at the opposite, distal heme side. In AcCYP51, the P450 \u2192 P420 transition is faster in the monomer than in the dimer, indicating that the dimeric assembly is critical for stabilizing thiolate coordination to the heme and thus for sustaining AcCYP51 activity. The spectroscopic experiments were complemented with size-exclusion chromatography and X-ray crystallography studies. Collectively, our results indicate that effective inactivation of the AcCYP51 function by azole drugs is due to synergistic interference with AcCYP51 dimerization and promoting irreversible displacement of the proximal heme-thiolate ligand."

The p97 consists of two ATPase domains and an N domain that interacts with numerous cofactors. The N domain of p97 is known to undergo a large nucleotide-dependent conformation switch, but its physiological relevance is unclear. Here we show p97 is recruited to canine ER membranes predominantly by interacting with VCP-interacting membrane protein (VIMP), an ER-resident protein. We found that the recruitment is modulated through a nucleotide-dependent conformation switch of the N domain in wild-type p97, but this modulation is absent in pathogenic mutants. We demonstrate the molecular mechanism of the modulation by a series of structures of p97, VIMP and their complexes and suggest a physiological role of the nucleotide-dependent N domain conformation switch. The lack of modulation in pathogenic mutants is caused by changes in interactions between the N and D1 domain, as demonstrated by multiple intermediate positions adopted by N domains of mutant p97. Our findings suggest the nucleotide-modulated membrane association may also have a role in other p97-dependent processes."

CT-Ler recognizes a preexisting structural pattern in the DNA minor groove formed by two consecutive regions which are narrower and wider, respectively, compared with standard B-DNA. The compressed region, associated with an AT-tract, is sensed by the side chain of Arg90, whose mutation abolishes the capacity of Ler to bind DNA. The expanded groove allows the approach of the loop in which Arg90 is located. This is the first report of an experimental structure of a DNA complex that includes a protein belonging to the H-NS family. The indirect readout mechanism not only explains the capacity of H-NS and other H-NS family members to modulate the expression of a large number of genes but also the origin of the specificity displayed by Ler. Our results point to a general mechanism by which horizontally acquired genes may be specifically recognized by members of the H-NS family."

In all three cases entropy compensation results in an affinity loss that would otherwise be larger. Comparison of the three mutant crystal structures with the WT structure demonstrates that the removal of direct antigen-antibody hydrogen bonds results in minimal shifts in the positions of the remaining protein atoms. These observations show that this complex is considerably tolerant, both structurally and thermodynamically, to the truncation of antibody side chains that form hydrogen bonds with the antigen. Alterations in interface solvent structure for two of the mutant complexes (VLY50S and VHY32A) appear to compensate for the unfavorable enthalpy changes when protein-protein interactions are removed. These changes in solvent structure, along with the increased mobility of side chains near the mutation site, probably contribute to the observed entropy compensation. For the VHY101F complex, the nature of the large entropy compensation is not evident from a structural comparison of the WT and mutant complexes. Differences in the local structure and dynamics of the uncomplexed Fv molecules may account for the entropic discrepancy in this case."

We have investigated mouse Paneth cell \u03b1-defensincryptdin-4 (Crp4) and peptide variants with mutations at Arg7 or Glu15 residue positions to disrupt the salt-bridge and assess the consequences on Crp4 structure, function, and stability. NMR analyses showed that both (R7G)-Crp4 and (E15G)-Crp4 adopt native-like structures, evidence of fold plasticity that allows peptides to reshuffle side chains and stabilize the structure in the absence of the salt-bridge. In contrast, introduction of a large hydrophobic side chain at position 15, as in (E15L)-Crp4 cannot be accommodated in the context of the Crp4 primary structure. Regardless of which side of the salt-bridge was mutated, salt-bridge variants retained bactericidal peptide activity with differential microbicidal effects against certain bacterial cell targets, confirming that the salt-bridge does not determine bactericidal activity per se. The increased structural flexibility induced by salt-bridge disruption enhanced peptide sensitivity to proteolysis. Although sensitivity to proteolysis by MMP7 was unaffected by most Arg(7) and Glu(150 substitutions, every salt-bridge variant was degraded extensively by trypsin. Moreover, the salt-bridge facilitates adoption of the characteristic \u03b1-defensin fold as shown by the impaired in vitro refolding of (E15D)-proCrp4, the most conservative salt-bridge disrupting replacement. In Crp4, therefore, the canonical \u03b1-defensin salt-bridge facilitates adoption of the characteristic \u03b1-defensin fold, which decreases structural flexibility and confers resistance todegradation by proteinases."

Previous reports of the three-dimensional structures of TAZ1 in complex with binding partners and of the isolated CBP TAZ2 domain show a distinctive topology composed of four amphipathic helices, organized by three zinc-binding clusters with HCCC-type coordination. The isolated CBP TAZ2 domain forms a stable three-dimensional structure in solution, but a recent report [Dial, R., Sun, Z., and Freedman, S. J. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 9937] suggested that the isolated p300 TAZ1 domain lacks a well-defined structure and behaves like a molten globule, even in the presence of Zn(2+), and that the formation of a stable three-dimensional structure requires binding of a protein partner. In marked contrast to this result, we find that both the CBP and p300 TAZ domains in the presence of stoichiometric concentrations of Zn(2+) adopt a well-defined structure in solution in the absence of binding partners. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the isolated CBP TAZ1 domain by NMR methods and show that it has the same structure in the presence and absence of binding partners. This is an important finding: whether the free TAZ1 domain forms a folded structure or behaves as a molten globule will have a significant bearing on the mechanism of protein-protein recognition. Although TAZ1 and TAZ2 share many structural similarities, there is a major structural difference: the fourth helix is oriented in opposite directions in the TAZ1 and TAZ2 domains. The structure of the free TAZ1 domain suggests that this difference is an inherent feature that determines binding specificity and facilitates discrimination between different subsets of transcription factors by the two TAZ domains."

It catalyzes the synthesis of a noncanonical cyclic dinucleotide, 2',5' cGAMP, that binds to STING and mediates the activation of TBK1 and IRF-3. Activated IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus and initiates the transcription of the IFN-\u03b2 gene. The structure of mouse cGAS bound to an 18 bp dsDNA revealed that cGAS interacts with dsDNA through two binding sites, forming a 2:2 complex. Enzyme assays and IFN-\u03b2 reporter assays of cGAS mutants demonstrated that interactions at both DNA binding sites are essential for cGAS activation. Mutagenesis and DNA binding studies showed that the two sites bind dsDNA cooperatively and that site B plays a critical role in DNA binding. The structure of mouse cGAS bound to dsDNA and 2',5' cGAMP provided insight into the catalytic mechanism of cGAS. These results demonstrated that cGAS is activated by dsDNA-induced oligomerization."

The p97 consists of two ATPase domains and an N domain that interacts with numerous cofactors. The N domain of p97 is known to undergo a large nucleotide-dependent conformation switch, but its physiological relevance is unclear. Here we show p97 is recruited to canine ER membranes predominantly by interacting with VCP-interacting membrane protein (VIMP), an ER-resident protein. We found that the recruitment is modulated through a nucleotide-dependent conformation switch of the N domain in wild-type p97, but this modulation is absent in pathogenic mutants. We demonstrate the molecular mechanism of the modulation by a series of structures of p97, VIMP and their complexes and suggest a physiological role of the nucleotide-dependent N domain conformation switch. The lack of modulation in pathogenic mutants is caused by changes in interactions between the N and D1 domain, as demonstrated by multiple intermediate positions adopted by N domains of mutant p97. Our findings suggest the nucleotide-modulated membrane association may also have a role in other p97-dependent processes."

To elucidate the structural basis of this mutual activation, it is necessary to determine the structures of the alpha- and beta-subunits alone and together with the alpha(2)beta(2)-complex. The crystal structures of the tryptophan synthase alpha(2)beta(2)-complex from Salmonella typhimurium (Stalpha(2)beta(2)-complex) have already been reported. However, the structures of the subunit alone from mesophiles have not yet been determined. The structure of the tryptophan synthase alpha-subunit alone from Escherichia coli (Ecalpha-subunit) was determined by an X-ray crystallographic analysis at 2.3 A, which is the first report on the subunits alone from the mesophiles. The biggest difference between the structures of the Ecalpha-subunit alone and the alpha-subunit in the Stalpha(2)beta(2)-complex (Stalpha-subunit) was as follows. Helix 2' in the Stalpha-subunit, including an active site residue (Asp60), was changed to a flexible loop in the Ecalpha-subunit alone. The conversion of the helix to a loop resulted in the collapse of the correct active site conformation. This region is also an important part for the mutual activation in the Stalpha(2)beta(2)-complex and interaction with the beta-subunit. These results suggest that the formation of helix 2'that is essential for the stimulation of the enzymatic activity of the alpha-subunit is constructed by the induced-fit mode involved in conformational changes upon interaction between the alpha- and beta-subunits. This also confirms the prediction of the conformational changes based on the thermodynamic analysis for the association between the alpha- and beta-subunits."

Previously we have shown that this is achieved through the modular architecture of the interaction network formed by the interface residues, where tight cooperative interactions are found within modules but not between them. Here we extend this study to cover the entire interface of TEM1 beta-lactamase and its protein inhibitor BLIP using an improved method for deriving interaction maps based on REDUCE to add hydrogen atoms and then by evaluating the interactions using modifications of the programs PROBE, NCI and PARE. An extensive mutagenesis study of the interface residues indeed showed that each module is energetically independent on other modules, and that cooperativity is found only within a module. By solving the X-ray structure of two interface mutations affecting two different modules, we demonstrated that protein-protein binding occur via the structural reorganization of the binding modules, either by a \"lock and key\" or an induced fit mechanism. To explain the cooperativity within a module, we performed multiple-mutant cycle analysis of cluster 2 resulting in a high-resolution energy map of this module. Mutant studies are usually done in reference to alanine, which can be regarded as a deletion of a side-chain. However, from a biological perspective, there is a major interest to understand non-Ala substitutions, as they are most common. Using X-ray crystallography and multiple-mutant cycle analysis we demonstrated the added complexity in understanding non-Ala mutations. Here, a double mutation replacing the wild-type Glu,Tyr to Tyr,Asn on TEM1 (res id 104,105) caused a major backbone structural rearrangement of BLIP, changing the composition of two modules but not of other modules within the interface. This shows the robustness of the modular approach, yet demonstrates the complexity of in silico protein design."

In the wild-type (WT) FvD1.3-HEL complex, the hydroxyl groups of VLTyr50, VHTyr32, and VHTyr101 each form at least one hydrogen bond with the lysozyme antigen. Thermodynamic parameters for antibody-antigen association have been measured using isothermal titration calorimetry, giving equilibrium binding constants Kb (M-1) of 2.6 x 10(7) (VLY50S), 7.0 x 10(7) (VHY32A), and 4.0 x 10(6) (VHY101F). For the WT complex, Kb is 2.7 x 10(8) M-1; thus, the affinities of the mutant Fv fragments for HEL are 10-, 4-, and 70-fold lower than that of the original antibody, respectively. In all three cases entropy compensation results in an affinity loss that would otherwise be larger. Comparison of the three mutant crystal structures with the WT structure demonstrates that the removal of direct antigen-antibody hydrogen bonds results in minimal shifts in the positions of the remaining protein atoms. These observations show that this complex is considerably tolerant, both structurally and thermodynamically, to the truncation of antibody side chains that form hydrogen bonds with the antigen. Alterations in interface solvent structure for two of the mutant complexes (VLY50S and VHY32A) appear to compensate for the unfavorable enthalpy changes when protein-protein interactions are removed. These changes in solvent structure, along with the increased mobility of side chains near the mutation site, probably contribute to the observed entropy compensation. For the VHY101F complex, the nature of the large entropy compensation is not evident from a structural comparison of the WT and mutant complexes. Differences in the local structure and dynamics of the uncomplexed Fv molecules may account for the entropic discrepancy in this case."

The molecular basis of this activation event lies at the heart of the regulation of hemostasis and accounts for the anticoagulant properties of the low molecular weight heparins. Although several structures of AT have been solved, the conformation of the RCL in native AT remains unknown because of the obligate crystal contact between the RCL of native AT and its latent counterpart. Here we report the crystallographic structure of a variant of AT in its monomeric native state. The RCL shifted approximately 20 A, and a salt bridge was observed between the P1 residue (Arg-393) and Glu-237. This contact explains the effect of mutations at the P1 position on the affinity of AT for heparin and also the properties of AT-Truro (E237K). The relevance of the observed conformation was verified through mutagenesis studies and by solving structures of the same variant in different crystal forms.

Within the HIF-2 complex, one domain (HIF-2\u03b1 PAS-B) contains a large (290\u00a0\u00c5 <sup>3 </sup>) buried cavity filled with water molecules within its hydrophobic core. Such cavities are uncommon except in the case of ligand-binding proteins, leading to the hypothesis that HIF-2\u03b1 can be regulated by small molecules. The development of artificial HIF-2\u03b1 inhibitors validates this hypothesis but raises questions about the impact of this cavity on HIF-2\u03b1 PAS-B structure and function. To answer these points, we used computational methods to construct a repacked protein containing a smaller cavity within the native fold. Experimental validation of a five-mutation variant confirms achieving these objectives and stabilizing the folded structure. Complementary functional data establish that ligands cannot bind this variant although heterodimerization remains unchanged. Altogether, our strategy innovatively addresses the roles of solvated cavities in maintaining protein stability and function."

Our structure/function analysis demonstrated that the binding of the monosaccharide alpha-D-mannose is the primary bladder cell receptor for uropathogenic E. coli and that this event requires a highly conserved FimH binding pocket. The residues in the FimH mannose-binding pocket were sequenced and found to be invariant in over 200 uropathogenic strains of E. coli.

Apo(a) contains 14-37 kringle 4 (KIV) repeats distributed into 10 classes (1-10). Lp(a) binds lysine-Sepharose via a lysine binding site (LBS) located in KIV-10 (88% homology with plasminogen K4). However, the W72R substitution that occurs in rhesus monkeys and occasionally in humans leads to impaired lysine binding capacity of KIV-10 and Lp(a). The foregoing has been investigated by determining the structures of KIV-10/M66 (M66 variant) in its unliganded and ligand [epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA)] bound modes and the structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 (the W72R mutant). In addition, the EACA liganded structure of a sequence polymorph (M66T in about 42-50% of the human population) was reexamined (KIV-10/T66/EACA). The KIV-10/M66, KIV-10/M66/EACA, and KIV-10/T66/EACA molecular structures are highly isostructural, indicating that the LBS of the kringles is preformed anticipating ligand binding. A displacement of three water molecules from the EACA binding groove and a movement of R35 bringing the guanidinium group close to the carboxylate of EACA to assist R71 in stabilizing the anionic group of the ligand are the only changes accompanying ligand binding. Both EACA structures were in the embedded binding mode utilizing all three binding centers (anionic, hydrophobic, cationic) like plasminogen kringles 1 and 4. The KIV-10/T66/EACA structure determined in this work differs from one previously reported [Mikol, V., Lo Grasso, P. V. and, Boettcher, B. R. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 256, 751-761], which crystallized in a different crystal system and displayed an unbound binding mode, where only the amino group of EACA interacted with the anionic center of the LBS. The remainder of the ligand extended into solvent perpendicular to the kringle surface, leaving the hydrophobic pocket and the cationic center of the LBS unoccupied. The structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 shows that R72 extends along the ligand binding groove parallel to the expected position of EACA toward the anionic center (D55/D57) and makes a salt bridge with D57. Thus, the R72 side chain mimics ligand binding, and loss of binding ability is the result of steric blockage of the LBS by R72 physically occupying part of the site. The rhesus monkey lysine binding impairment is compared with that of chimpanzee where KIV-10 has been shown to have a D57N mutation instead."

Thermodynamic parameters are compared with those of the homologous leucine zipper AB(SS) in which the A and B chains are disulfide-linked. NMR structures of AB based on (1)H NMR data collected at 600 MHz converge, and formation of the same six interchain salt bridges found previously in disulfide-linked AB(SS) [Marti, D.

The stability of AB peaks at pH approximately 4.5 and is higher at pH 8 than at pH 2. In contrast, AB(SS) is most stable at acidic pH where no interhelical salt bridges are formed. The different energetic contributions of charged Glu and His residues to stability of the two coiled coil structures were evaluated from pK(a) shifts induced by folding. The six charged Glu residues involved in salt bridges stabilize leucine zipper AB by 4.5 kJ/mol yet destabilize disulfide-linked AB(SS) by -1.1 kJ/mol. Two non-ion-paired Glu charges destabilize AB by only -1.8 kJ/mol but AB(SS) by -5.6 kJ/mol. The higher relative stability of AB at neutral pH is not caused by more favorable electrostatic interactions in the folded leucine zipper. It is due mainly to unfavorable electrostatic interactions in the unfolded A and B chains and may therefore be called an inverse electrostatic effect. This study illustrates the importance of residual interactions in the unfolded state and how the energetics of the unfolded state affect the stability of the folded protein."

This contrasts with pyrophosphate binding in the wild-type enzyme, where pyrophosphate coordinates three Mg(2+) ions and triggers a significant conformational change that closes the mouth of the active site and optimizes packing density in the enzyme-substrate complex. The attenuation of active site closure in D100E trichodiene synthase compromises enzyme-substrate packing density and confers additional spatial and conformational degrees of freedom on the substrate and carbocation intermediates, which in turn results in the formation of five alternate sesquiterpene products in addition to trichodiene.

The nucleotides are immobilized on the face of subdomains 3 and 4 of Arp2, whereas subdomains 1 and 2 are flexible and absent from the electron density maps. This flexibility may explain why Arp2 does not hydrolyze ATP until the complex is activated. ATP stabilizes a relatively closed conformation of Arp3 with the gamma-phosphate bridging loops from opposite sides of the cleft. ADP binds Arp3 in a unique conformation that favors an open cleft, revealing a conformational change that may occur in actin and Arps when ATP is hydrolyzed and phosphate dissociates. These structures provide the an opportunity to compare all nucleotide-binding states in an actin-related protein and give insights into the function of both the Arp2/3 complex and actin."

They are thought to assemble around a nine-fold symmetric cartwheel structure established by SAS-6 proteins. Here, we have engineered Chlamydomonas reinhardtii SAS-6-based oligomers with symmetries ranging from five- to ten-fold. Expression of a SAS-6 mutant that forms six-fold symmetric cartwheel structures in vitro resulted in cartwheels and centrioles with eight- or nine-fold symmetries in vivo. In combination with Bld10 mutants that weaken cartwheel-microtubule interactions, this SAS-6 mutant produced six- to eight-fold symmetric cartwheels. Concurrently, the microtubule wall maintained eight- and nine-fold symmetries. Expressing SAS-6 with analogous mutations in human cells resulted in nine-fold symmetric centrioles that exhibited impaired length and organization. Together, our data suggest that the self-assembly properties of SAS-6 instruct cartwheel symmetry, and lead us to propose a model in which the cartwheel and the microtubule wall assemble in an interdependent manner to establish the native architecture of centrioles.

The D100E amino acid substitution in the so-called \"aspartate-rich\" motif does not result in large changes to the overall structure of the enzyme. In the pyrophosphate complex, however, pyrophosphate coordinates two Mg(2+) ions at the mouth of the active site without causing large changes in the structure of the enzyme. This contrasts with pyrophosphate binding in the wild-type enzyme, where pyrophosphate coordinates three Mg(2+) ions and triggers a significant conformational change that closes the mouth of the active site and optimizes packing density in the enzyme-substrate complex. The attenuation of active site closure in D100E trichodiene synthase compromises enzyme-substrate packing density and confers additional spatial and conformational degrees of freedom on the substrate and carbocation intermediates, which in turn results in the formation of five alternate sesquiterpene products in addition to trichodiene. By extension, then, the diversity of terpene cyclases in biology may have evolved in part by amino acid substitutions that fine-tune structural changes dependent on metal-diphosphate complexation that govern the formation of the active site template and enzyme-substrate packing density."

Changes to protein expression in Aurora A, a mitotic Ser/Thr kinase, are associated with the development of several human cancers, but the effects of somatic cancer-associated mutations have not been determined. In this study we show that Aurora A kinase activity is altered in different ways in three somatic cancer-associated mutations located within the catalytic domain; Aurora A(V174M) shows constitutively increased kinase activity, Aurora A(S155R) activity is decreased primarily due to misregulation, and Aurora A(S361*) activity is ablated due to loss of structural integrity. These alterations suggest vastly different mechanisms for the role of these three mutations in human cancer. We have further characterized the Aurora A(S155R) mutant protein, found that its reduced cellular activity and mislocalization are due to loss of interaction with TPX2, and deciphered the structural basis of the disruption at 2.5 A resolution. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the Aurora A/TPX2 interaction results in defective spindles that generate chromosomal abnormalities. In a panel of 40 samples from microsatellite instability-positive colon cancer patients, we found one example in which the tumor contained only Aurora A(S155R), whereas the normal tissue contained only wild-type Aurora A. We propose that the S155R mutation is an example of a somatic mutation associated with this tumor type, albeit at modest frequency, that could promote aneuploidy through the loss of regulated interactions between Aurora A and its protein partners."

For this purpose, we have developed a simple assay based on the antipodal behavior of the two proteins toward hydrolysis of biotinyl p-nitrophenyl ester (BNP). The assay provided the experimental basis for these studies. It was found that biotin migrates unidirectionally from streptavidin to avidin. Conversely, the biotin derivative, BNP, is transferred in the opposite direction, from avidin to streptavidin. A previous crystallographic study (Huberman, T., Eisenberg-Domovich, Y., Gitlin, G., Kulik, T., Bayer, E. A., Wilchek, M., and Livnah, O. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 32031-32039) provided insight into a plausible explanation for these results. These data revealed that the non-hydrolyzable BNP analogue, biotinyl p-nitroanilide, was almost completely sheltered in streptavidin as opposed to avidin in which the disordered conformation of a critical loop resulted in the loss of several hydrogen bonds and concomitant exposure of the analogue to the solvent. In order to determine the minimal modification of the biotin molecule required to cause the disordered loop conformation, the structures of avidin and streptavidin were determined with norbiotin, homobiotin, and a common long-chain biotin derivative, biotinyl epsilon-aminocaproic acid. Six new crystal structures of the avidin and streptavidin complexes with the latter biotin analogues and derivatives were thus elucidated. It was found that extending the biotin side chain by a single CH(2) group (i.e. homobiotin) is sufficient to result in this remarkable conformational change in the loop of avidin. These results bear significant biotechnological importance, suggesting that complexes containing biotinylated probes with streptavidin would be more stable than those with avidin. These findings should be heeded when developing new drugs based on lead compounds because it is difficult to predict the structural and conformational consequences on the resultant protein-ligand interactions."

A large conformational change accompanies binding of phosphoryl donor, acceptor, or both, in all members of the ribokinase superfamily characterized thus far, which is believed to be critical to enzyme function. Surprisingly, no such conformational change was observed in the AMP-bound PhPFK structure compared with the apo structure. Through comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis of the substrate binding pocket we identified residues that were critical for both substrate recognition and the phosphotransfer reaction. The catalytic residues and many of the substrate binding residues are conserved between PhPFK and ADP-GKs; however, four key residues differ in the sugar-binding pocket, which we have shown determine the sugar-binding specificity.

Furthermore, the domains and the linker could be delineated into fixed and variable regions in a physically meaningful manner. The relative mobility of the domains of the molecule in the crystal structure appears to be similar to that in the ribosome--RRF complex.

Antibody structures have become an integral part of predicting the behavior of potential therapeutics, either directly or as the basis of modeling. Structures of Fab:antigen complexes have even greater value. While the crystallization and structure determination of Fabs is easy relative to many other protein classes, especially membrane proteins, broad screening and optimization of crystalline hits is still necessary. Through a comprehensive review of rabbit Fab crystal contacts and their incompatibility with human Fabs, we identified a small secondary structural element from the rabbit light chain constant domain potentially responsible for hindering the crystallization of human Fabs. Upon replacing the human kappa constant domain FG loop (HQGLSSP) with the two residue shorter rabbit loop (QGTTS), we dramatically improved the crystallization of human Fabs and Fab:antigen complexes. Our design, which we call \"Crystal Kappa\", enables rapid crystallization of human fabs and fab complexes in a broad range of conditions, with less material in smaller screens or from dilute solutions."

In all eukaryotes, the six-subunit origin recognition complex (Orc1-6; ORC) recognizes the replication origin. During late M-phase of the cell-cycle, Cdc6 binds to ORC and the ORC-Cdc6 complex loads in a multistep reaction and, with the help of Cdt1, the core Mcm2-7 helicase onto DNA. A key intermediate is the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex in which DNA has been already inserted into the central channel of Mcm2-7. Until now, it has been unclear how the origin DNA is guided by ORC-Cdc6 and inserted into the Mcm2-7 hexamer. Here, we truncated the C-terminal winged-helix-domain (WHD) of Mcm6 to slow down the loading reaction, thereby capturing two loading intermediates prior to DNA insertion in budding yeast. In \"semi-attached OCCM,\" the Mcm3 and Mcm7 WHDs latch onto ORC-Cdc6 while the main body of the Mcm2-7 hexamer is not connected. In \"pre-insertion OCCM,\" the main body of Mcm2-7 docks onto ORC-Cdc6, and the origin DNA is bent and positioned adjacent to the open DNA entry gate, poised for insertion, at the Mcm2-Mcm5 interface. We used molecular simulations to reveal the dynamic transition from preloading conformers to the loaded conformers in which the loading of Mcm2-7 on DNA is complete and the DNA entry gate is fully closed.

Despite accumulating evidence for the formation of TPR oligomers as an additional level of regulation there is a lack of structural and solution data explaining TPR self-association. In the present work we characterize the trimeric TPR-containing protein YbgF, which is linked to the Tol system in Gram-negative bacteria. By subtracting previously identified TPR consensus residues required for stability of the fold from residues conserved across YbgF homologs, we identified residues involved in oligomerization of the C-terminal YbgF TPR domain. Crafting these residues, which are located in loop regions between TPR motifs, onto the monomeric consensus TPR protein CTPR3 induced the formation of oligomers. The crystal structure of this engineered oligomer shows an asymmetric trimer where stacking interactions between the introduced tyrosines and displacement of the C-terminal hydrophilic capping helix, present in most TPR domains, are key to oligomerization. Asymmetric trimerization of the YbgF TPR domain and CTPR3Y3 leads to the formation of higher order oligomers both in the crystal and in solution. However, such open-ended self-association does not occur in full-length YbgF suggesting that the protein's N-terminal coiled-coil domain restricts further oligomerization. This interpretation is borne out in experiments where the coiled-coil domain of YbgF was engineered onto the N-terminus of CTPR3Y3 and shown to block self-association beyond trimerization. Our study lays the foundations for understanding the structural basis for TPR domain self-association and how such self-association can be regulated in TPR domain-containing proteins."

The binding mode of the aldehyde donor delineated a solvent-filled capacious binding locus lined with predominantly hydrophobic residues. The absence of direct interactions with the aldehyde aliphatic carbons accounts for the broad specificity and lack of stereospecific control by the enzyme. Enzymatic complex structures formed with keto acceptors, pyruvate, and 2-ketobutyrate revealed bidentate interaction with the divalent metal ion by C1-carboxyl and C2-carbonyl oxygens and water molecule W4 that is within close contact of the C3 carbon. Arg(70) assumes a multivalent role through its guanidinium moiety interacting with all active site enzymatic species: C2 oxygen in substrate, pyruvate, and ketobutyrate; substrate C4 hydroxyl; aldehyde C1 oxygen; and W4. The multiple interactions made by Arg(70) stabilize the negatively charged C4 oxygen following proton abstraction, the aldehyde alignment in aldol condensation, and the pyruvate enolate upon aldol cleavage as well as support proton exchange at C3. This role is corroborated by loss of aldol cleavage ability and pyruvate C3 proton exchange activity and by a 730-fold increase in the dissociation constant toward the pyruvate enolate analog oxalate in the R70A mutant.

PNP6Pglc maintained favorable interactions within the active site until the end of the MD simulation, while PNP6Pgal exhibited instability. The favorable binding of substrate stabilized the loops that surround the active site. Binding free energy calculations showed that the PNP6Pglc complex had a substantially lower binding energy compared to the PNP6Pgal complex.

Despite the profound importance of iGluRs to neurotransmission, little is known about the structures and dynamics of intact receptors in distinct functional states. Here, we elucidate the structures of the intact GluA2 AMPA receptor in an apo resting/closed state, in an activated/pre-open state bound with partial agonists and a positive allosteric modulator, and in a desensitized/closed state in complex with fluorowilliardiine. To probe the conformational properties of these states, we carried out double electron-electron resonance experiments on cysteine mutants and cryoelectron microscopy studies. We show how agonist binding modulates the conformation of the ligand-binding domain \"layer\" of the intact receptors and how, upon desensitization, the receptor undergoes large conformational rearrangements of the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. We define mechanistic principles by which to understand antagonism, activation, and desensitization in AMPA iGluRs. "

In all eukaryotes, the six-subunit origin recognition complex (Orc1-6; ORC) recognizes the replication origin. During late M-phase of the cell-cycle, Cdc6 binds to ORC and the ORC-Cdc6 complex loads in a multistep reaction and, with the help of Cdt1, the core Mcm2-7 helicase onto DNA. A key intermediate is the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1-Mcm2-7 (OCCM) complex in which DNA has been already inserted into the central channel of Mcm2-7. Until now, it has been unclear how the origin DNA is guided by ORC-Cdc6 and inserted into the Mcm2-7 hexamer. Here, we truncated the C-terminal winged-helix-domain (WHD) of Mcm6 to slow down the loading reaction, thereby capturing two loading intermediates prior to DNA insertion in budding yeast. In \"semi-attached OCCM,\" the Mcm3 and Mcm7 WHDs latch onto ORC-Cdc6 while the main body of the Mcm2-7 hexamer is not connected. In \"pre-insertion OCCM,\" the main body of Mcm2-7 docks onto ORC-Cdc6, and the origin DNA is bent and positioned adjacent to the open DNA entry gate, poised for insertion, at the Mcm2-Mcm5 interface. We used molecular simulations to reveal the dynamic transition from preloading conformers to the loaded conformers in which the loading of Mcm2-7 on DNA is complete and the DNA entry gate is fully closed. Our work provides multiple molecular insights into a key event of eukaryotic DNA replication."

N. meningitidis is a causative agent of meningitis and produces a capsular polysaccharide comprised of polysialic acid. This allows it to evade the immune system of the host by an act of molecular mimicry. This work describes the synthesis and characterization of the first potent inhibitor of sialic acid synthase. The inhibitor is a stable deoxy analogue of the tetrahedral intermediate presumed to form in the NeuB reaction and was synthesized as a mixture of stereoisomers at the key tetrahedral center. Inhibition studies demonstrate that one stereoisomer binds more tightly than the other and that the more potent isomer binds with micromolar affinity. An X-ray crystallographic analysis of the NeuB.inhibitor.Mn(2+) complex solved to a resolution of 1.75 A shows that the more tightly bound stereoisomer bears a (2R)-configuration. This suggests that the tetrahedral intermediate formed in the NeuB reaction also bears a (2R)-configuration. This analysis is consistent with a mechanism whereby the active site metal plays at least two roles during catalysis. First, it serves as an electrostatic catalyst and activates the aldehyde of ManNAc for attack by the alkene of PEP. Second, it serves as a source of nucleophilic water and delivers it to the si face of the oxocarbenium intermediate to generate a tetrahedral intermediate with a (2R)-configuration."

FeoB likely forms the channel, whose regulation has been suggested to involve its GTPase domain (part of its NFeoB domain). FeoC from Klebsiella pneumonia was found to contain a [4Fe4S] cofactor, whose presence was speculated to enhance the GTPase activity of FeoB (Hsueh, K.-L., et al., J. Bacteriol. 2013 195(20): 4726-34). We present results here that support and extend that hypothesis. We monitored the GTPase activity of FeoB by NMR spectroscopy and found that the presence of 7% FeoC-[4Fe-4S] <sup>3+ </sup> (the highest level of cofactor achieved in vitro) increased the GTPase rate of NFeoB by 3.6-fold over NFeoB. The effect depends on the oxidation state of the cluster; with reduction of the cluster to [4Fe-4S] <sup>2+ </sup> the GTPase greatly decreased the GTPase rate. From the effects of point mutations in FeoC on GTPase rates, we conclude that Lys62 and Lys68 on FeoC each contribute to increased GTPase activity on NFeoB. Mutation of Thr37 of NFeoB to Ser nearly abolished the GTPase activity. The GTPase activity of the isolated K. pneumoniae NFeoB-FeoC complex (NFeoBC) was found to be higher in KCl than in NaCl solution. We solved the X-ray structure of the NFeoBC crystallized from KCl and compared it with a prior X-ray structure crystalized from NaCl.

By systematically introducing point mutations at the subunit interfaces, two active monomeric variants, CstII-F121D and CstII-Y125Q, were obtained and characterized. In contrast to the wild-type tetramer, the monomeric CstII variants yielded good quality (1)H/(15)N-HSQC and (1)H/(13)C-methyl-TROSY NMR spectra. However, the absence of signals from approximately one-half of the amides in the (1)H/(15)N-HSQC spectra of both monomeric forms suggests that the enzyme undergoes substantial conformational exchange on a millisecond to microsecond time scale.

Thermodynamic analysis indicates that the interaction is entropically driven, which explains how the noncontacting C\u025b2 domains, in place of the flexible hinge region of IgG antibodies, contribute together with the conformational changes to the unique binding properties of IgE."

SspB is a large multi-domain protein that has interactions with surface molecules on other bacteria and on host cells, and is thus a key factor in the formation of biofilms. Here, we report the crystal structure of a truncated form of the SspB C-terminal domain, solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion to 1.5 A resolution. The structure represents the first of a C-terminal domain from a streptococcal Antigen I/II protein and is comprised of two structurally related beta-sandwich domains, C2 and C3, both with a Ca(2+) bound in equivalent positions. In each of the domains, a covalent isopeptide bond is observed between a lysine and an asparagine, a feature that is believed to be a common stabilization mechanism in Gram-positive surface proteins. S. gordonii biofilms contain attachment sites for the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and the SspB C-terminal domain has been shown to have one such recognition motif, the SspB adherence region. The motif protrudes from the protein, and serves as a handle for attachment. The structure suggests several additional putative binding surfaces, and other binding clefts may be created when the full-length protein is folded."

The structure reveals a homodimer as the functional unit. Each subunit contains two domains, a larger N-terminal catalytic domain and a smaller C-terminal domain. The structural feature of the active site has been studied by determination of the crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme with biotin, ADP and the reaction intermediate biotinyl-5'-AMP at atomic resolution. This is the first report of the liganded structures of biotin protein ligase with nucleotide and biotinyl-5'-AMP. The structures of the unliganded and the liganded forms are isomorphous except for an ordering of the active site loop upon ligand binding. Catalytic binding sites are suitably arranged to minimize the conformational changes required during the reaction, as the pockets for biotin and nucleotide are located spatially adjacent to each other in a cleft of the catalytic domain and the pocket for biotinyl-5'-AMP binding mimics the combination of those of the substrates. The exact locations of the ligands and the active site residues allow us to propose a general scheme for the first step of the reaction carried out by biotin protein ligase in which the positively charged epsilon-amino group of Lys111 facilitates the nucleophilic attack on the ATP alpha-phosphate group by the biotin carboxyl oxygen atom and stabilizes the negatively charged intermediates."

In this study, we have obtained crystallographic snapshots that reveal ligand-induced ordering of the N terminus of  <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i> ATR, which organizes a dynamic cobalamin binding site and exerts exquisite control over coordination geometry, reactivity, and solvent accessibility. Cob(II)alamin binds with its dimethylbenzimidazole tail splayed into a side pocket and its corrin ring buried. The cosubstrate, ATP, enforces a four-coordinate cob(II)alamin geometry, facilitating the unfavorable reduction to cob(I)alamin. The binding mode for AdoCbl is notably different from that of cob(II)alamin, with the dimethylbenzimidazole tail tucked under the corrin ring, displacing the N terminus of ATR, which is disordered. In this solvent-exposed conformation, AdoCbl undergoes facile transfer to MCM. The importance of the tail in cofactor handover from ATR to MCM is revealed by the failure of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobinamide, lacking the tail, to transfer. In the absence of MCM, ATR induces a sacrificial cobalt-carbon bond homolysis reaction in an unusual reversal of the heterolytic chemistry that was deployed to make the same bond. The data support an important role for the dimethylbenzimidazole tail in moving the cobalamin cofactor between active sites."

In SAGA, Sus1 binds to Sgf11 and has been proposed to provide a link between SAGA and TREX-2. We present here the crystal structure of the complex between Sus1 and the N-terminal region of Sgf11 that forms an extended alpha-helix around which Sus1 wraps in a manner that shares some similarities with the Sus1-Sac3 interface in TREX-2. However, the Sus1-binding site on Sgf11 is somewhat shorter than on Sac3 and is based on a narrower hydrophobic stripe. Engineered mutants that disrupt the Sgf11-Sus1 interaction in vitro confirm the importance of the hydrophobic helical stripe in molecular recognition. Helix alpha1 of the Sus1-articulated hairpin does not bind directly to Sgf11 and adopts a wide range of conformations within and between crystal forms, consistent with the presence of a flexible hinge and also with results from previous extensive mutagenesis studies (Kl\u00f6ckner, C., Schneider, M., Lutz, S., Jani, D., Kressler, D., Stewart, M., Hurt, E., and K\u00f6hler, A.

Oxygen activation is achieved by reduction of the ferrous dioxygen complex, which requires the transfer of an electron from a redox partner and subsequent double protonation to yield a water molecule and a ferryl porphyrin \u03c0-cation radical (Compound I). Previous studies of the CYP101 family of cytochrome P450s demonstrated the importance of the conserved active site Asp25X residue in this protonation event, although its precise role is yet to be unraveled.

However, the W72R substitution that occurs in rhesus monkeys and occasionally in humans leads to impaired lysine binding capacity of KIV-10 and Lp(a). The foregoing has been investigated by determining the structures of KIV-10/M66 (M66 variant) in its unliganded and ligand [epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA)] bound modes and the structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 (the W72R mutant). In addition, the EACA liganded structure of a sequence polymorph (M66T in about 42-50% of the human population) was reexamined (KIV-10/T66/EACA). The KIV-10/M66, KIV-10/M66/EACA, and KIV-10/T66/EACA molecular structures are highly isostructural, indicating that the LBS of the kringles is preformed anticipating ligand binding. A displacement of three water molecules from the EACA binding groove and a movement of R35 bringing the guanidinium group close to the carboxylate of EACA to assist R71 in stabilizing the anionic group of the ligand are the only changes accompanying ligand binding. Both EACA structures were in the embedded binding mode utilizing all three binding centers (anionic, hydrophobic, cationic) like plasminogen kringles 1 and 4. The KIV-10/T66/EACA structure determined in this work differs from one previously reported [Mikol, V., Lo Grasso, P. V. and, Boettcher, B. R. (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 256, 751-761], which crystallized in a different crystal system and displayed an unbound binding mode, where only the amino group of EACA interacted with the anionic center of the LBS. The remainder of the ligand extended into solvent perpendicular to the kringle surface, leaving the hydrophobic pocket and the cationic center of the LBS unoccupied. The structure of recombinant KIV-10/M66R72 shows that R72 extends along the ligand binding groove parallel to the expected position of EACA toward the anionic center (D55/D57) and makes a salt bridge with D57. Thus, the R72 side chain mimics ligand binding, and loss of binding ability is the result of steric blockage of the LBS by R72 physically occupying part of the site. The rhesus monkey lysine binding impairment is compared with that of chimpanzee where KIV-10 has been shown to have a D57N mutation instead."

Accuracy is crucial in peptide-MHC modeling, as T cell receptors are highly sensitive to peptide conformation and capturing fine details is therefore necessary for useful models.

However, the clinical utility of rifamycins against Mycobacterium abscessus is seriously compromised by a novel resistance mechanism, namely, rifamycin inactivation by ADP-ribosylation. Using a structure-based approach, we rationally redesign rifamycins through strategic modification of the ansa-chain to block ADP-ribosylation while preserving on-target activity. Validated by a combination of biochemical, structural, and microbiological studies, the most potent analogs overcome ADP-ribosylation, restored their intrinsic low nanomolar activity and demonstrated significant in vivo antibacterial efficacy. Further optimization by tuning drug disposition properties afforded a preclinical candidate with remarkable potency and an outstanding pharmacokinetic profile."

        "caption": "Cyclosporin (CsA) has antiparasite activity against the human pathogen  <i>Toxoplasma gondii </i>. A possible mechanism of action involves CsA binding to  <i>T. gondii </i> cyclophilins, although much remains to be understood. Herein, we characterize the functional and structural properties of a conserved (TgCyp23) and a more divergent (TgCyp18.4) cyclophilin isoform from  <i>T. gondii </i>. While TgCyp23 is a highly active cis-trans-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) and binds CsA with nanomolar affinity, TgCyp18.4 shows low PPIase activity and is significantly less sensitive to CsA inhibition. The crystal structure of the TgCyp23:CsA complex was solved at the atomic resolution showing the molecular details of CsA recognition by the protein. Computational and structural studies revealed relevant differences at the CsA-binding site between TgCyp18.4 and TgCyp23, suggesting that the two cyclophilins might have distinct functions in the parasite. These studies highlight the extensive diversification of TgCyps and pave the way for antiparasite interventions based on selective targeting of cyclophilins."

        "caption": "Chemical signalling in the plant microbiome can have drastic effects on microbial community structure, and on host growth and development. Previously, we demonstrated that the auxin metabolic signal interference performed by the bacterial genus Variovorax via an auxin degradation locus was essential for maintaining stereotypic root development in an ecologically relevant bacterial synthetic community. Here, we dissect the Variovorax auxin degradation locus to define the genes iadDE as necessary and sufficient for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) degradation and signal interference. We determine the crystal structures and binding properties of the operon's MarR-family repressor with IAA and other auxins. Auxin degradation operons were identified across the bacterial tree of life and we define two distinct types on the basis of gene content and metabolic products: iac-like and iad-like. The structures of MarRs from representatives of each auxin degradation operon type establish that each has distinct IAA-binding pockets. Comparison of representative IAA-degrading strains from diverse bacterial genera colonizing Arabidopsis plants show that while all degrade IAA, only strains containing iad-like auxin-degrading operons interfere with auxin signalling in a complex synthetic community context. This suggests that iad-like operon-containing bacterial strains, including Variovorax species, play a key ecological role in modulating auxins in the plant microbiome."
